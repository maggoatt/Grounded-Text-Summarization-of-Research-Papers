Many algorithms for constructing such ensembles have been developed. But the problem of choosing the algorithm with the best accuracy is very topical and important in practice. In this connection the work is aimed at the comparison of the new observations classification accuracy provided by decision tree ensembles constructed by different algorithms. \n\nAnalysis of recent researches and publications. Decision tree ensemble is a special case of a classifier ensemble in which decision trees are used as basic classifiers. The main idea of the classifier ensemble is to combine a set of basic classifiers in order to make more accurate predictions than any single classifier is able to [1]. It is known that ensembles can improve the accuracy, stability and robustness of basic classifiers. But the following properties should be taken into account while constructing ensemble: the correlation and diversity in basic classifiers, the number of classifiers in the ensemble, the method of combination of basic classifiers predictions and the portion of the original dataset, used to train a certain classifier, is also used to train other classifiers [1]. \n\nSome techniques have been developed to construct classifier ensembles including decision tree ensembles: bagging, boosting, stacking [1]. \n\nBagging (bootstrap aggregating) was proposed by Leo Breiman in 1994 [2]. It reduces the variance of classifiers and helps avoid overfitting. In bagging each classifier (typically decision tree) in the ensemble is trained on a random sample with replacement obtained from the training dataset (bootstrap sample). The bootstrap sample has the same cardinality as the original training set, but many of the original examples may be repeated in the bootstrap sample while others may be left out. The predictions of the trained classifiers are combined by majority voting. The Random Forest is an extension over bagging with decision trees as basic classifiers [3]. It differs from the bagging in one way: it uses a modified tree learning algorithm in which a random subset of features (instead of all features) is used while splitting each tree node. This random selection of features allows to reduce the correlation in trees in the ensemble and thereby leads to better ensemble performance. \n\nAs an extension of the Random Forest idea the Extra-Trees algorithm that constructs an extremely randomized tree ensemble [4] and the algorithm that constructs a perfect random tree ensemble [5] can be considered. Both of them combine decision trees in ensemble by majority voting and build each tree on the entire dataset but randomly. \n\nBoosting is another ensemble technique that sequentially constructs \"weak\" classifiers (typically decision trees) each of which tries to correct the errors of the previous ones. Then the \"weak\" classifiers are combined in a \"strong\" one by weighted voting [1]. This technique reduces the bias of classifiers. One of well-known boosting algorithms is AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) developed by Robert Schapire and Yoav Freund in 1996. Each \"weak\" classifier is trained on a random sample obtained from the training dataset using examples weights. These weights change in each iteration of the algorithm: they increase for examples that are misclassified and decrease for examples that are correctly classified. Thus, the subsequent classifier is trained to correctly predict the examples misclassified by the previous ones. A more effective extension over boosting is gradient boosting that was proposed in 1999 but was published officially later [6]. Its idea is that boosting can be interpreted as an optimization algorithm on a suitable cost function. In [6] it is introduced as an iterative functional gradient descent algorithm. The gradient boosting is implemented in XGBoost [7], LightGBM and CatBoost libraries which have helped win various machine learning competitions many a time. Their effectiveness can be explained by the following key properties: work speed, possibility of paralleling calculations and the video card power use, scalability for big data and various optimizations of the original algorithm. \n\nStacking (1992) is a technique of combining classifiers, that introduces a meta-learner concept. The stacking algorithm involves the following steps [1]: 1) split the training set into two disjoint sets; 2) train several basic classifiers on the first part; 3) test the basic classifiers on the second part; 4) use the predictions from the third step as the inputs and the correct responses as the outputs, train a higher level classifier. In [6] authors proposed a modified stacking algorithm that uses a genetic algorithm (GA) to create an ensemble and improve the performance of the standard stacking algorithm [8]. \n\nBased on the carried out survey the most popular, widely used and wellfunctioning (according to other experimental results) decision tree ensemble constructing algorithms were chosen for comparison: \n\n− Random Forest, based on bagging [3]; − Extra-Trees algorithm [4]; − algorithm that constructs a perfect random tree ensemble [5] − gradient boosting and its implementation from XGBoost library [6,7]; − GA-based stacking ensemble algorithm [8]. \n\nTask definition. The task is to carry out computational experiments to compare the chosen decision tree ensemble constructing algorithms with regard to the classification accuracy. \n\nMain material. To perform the computational experiments own software was developed in the Visual Studio on the C# programming language. The software is a desktop application which allows to construct ensembles using the Random Forest, Extra-Trees algorithm, algorithm that constructs a perfect random trees ensemble, GA-based stacking ensemble algorithm and also using open-source implementations of the Random Forest (Accord.NET Framework [9]) and gradient boosting (XGBoost library [7]). It has user friendly graphical interface and allows a user to − load samples of any size and dimension, − construct ensembles of as many trees as a user wishes, − view constructed trees, − analyze ensemble constructing time and the total number of leaves, − estimate the classification accuracy using a test set or cross-validation. The software also allows comparing the mean classification accuracy over randomly partitions of a dataset for different algorithms using the two sample t test [10]. \n\nThe main program window is shown in Figure 1. \n\nFigure 1 -The main program window\n\nIn order to compare algorithms implemented in the software, we carried out computational experiments on 10 real datasets with different sizes and dimensions using the created software. All the datasets were taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository [11]. \n\nThe experiment for each dataset and algorithm was conducted in this way. The dataset was randomly split into two sets: training and test. An ensemble of 50 trees was learned on the training set using the algorithm and the classification accuracy was estimated on the test set. To reduce the variability arising due to random splitting and randomness in the algorithm this process was repeated 30 times and the results were averaged over the splits. The mean classification accuracy over 30 splits and standard deviation of the mean were calculated. \n\n. АКТУАЛЬНІ ПРОБЛЕМИ АВТОМАТИЗАЦІЇ ТА ІНФОРМАЦІЙНИХ ТЕХНОЛОГІЙ.

The maximum mean classification accuracy and the accuracies that equal it according to the two-sample t test are marked bold in Table 1.  2 reports on the \"win/draw/loss\" statuses of all pairs of algorithms by the results of the t test performing. In each pair the algorithm had the \"win\" status if its mean classification accuracy was greater than that of another algorithm, the \"loss\" status if it was less and \"draw\" status otherwise. Considering the computational experiments results the Extra-Trees algorithm showed the best performance: the ensemble constructed using it had the maximum classification accuracy on 7 datasets and won or at least did not lose with respect to the ensembles constructed using other algorithms on most datasets. The Random Forest and the gradient boosting from the XGBoost library provided the maximum classification accuracy on 5 and 4 datasets respectively and very rarely lost with respect to other algorithms (Table 2). The algorithm that constructs a perfect random tree ensemble, the GA-based stacking ensemble algorithm and the Random Forest from the Accord.NET Framework often lost. \n\nConclusions. In the paper the comparative analysis of six decision tree ensemble constructing algorithms with regard to the classification accuracy was carried out. The computational experiments were performed on 10 real datasets with different sizes and dimensions from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The experiments were performed with the software developed in the Visual Studio on the C# programming language. According to the experiments results the Extra-Trees algorithm showed the best performance (the maximum classification accuracy on 7 datasets out of 10). The Random Forest and the gradient boosting from the XGBoost library also provided good classification accuracy with respect to other algorithms. The worst results were obtained using the algorithm that constructs a perfect random tree ensemble, the GA-based stacking ensemble algorithm and the Random Forest from the Accord.NET Framework. \n\nFurther researches can be directed to discover the relationship between the number of trees in the ensemble and the classification accuracy. \n\n\n\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n \n",

Sibille"], "body": {"text": "\nincreases in symptoms related to depression. 2 This report focuses on major depression and its associated symptoms as critical factors and potential modulators of a proposed age-by-disease interaction model. Major depression affects subjects of all ages, increases morbidity in the context of several organ diseases, and overall causes greater disability than all other psychiatric disorders. 3 Major depression is a severe mental illness that is defined by specific sets of symptoms, but low mood and anhedonia, the two core symptom dimensions of the illness, are observed across major mental illnesses and neurodegenerative disorders. Importantly, biological pathways associated with depression overlap with those frequently implicated in aging processes (eg , stress, inflammation, immune recruitment, and metabolic syndrome), prompting the hypothesis of accelerated aging in depressed subjects. 4 Notably, chronic stress, a common precipitating factor in depression, recruits similar pathways and has been suggested as a factor leading to accelerated aging. 5 Conversely, while major depression per se does not increase with older age, a constellation of related symptoms are present in many elderly subjects, even if not categorically diagnosed as depression. 2 However, there is also a large variability in individual susceptibility to develop depression and related symptoms with increasing age, and while some dysfunction appears inevitable, successful emotional, physical, and cognitive aging is achievable . This suggests that agerelated biological mechanisms and functional outcomes, including vulnerability to experience depressive symptoms, can be slowed down under certain circumstances, and/or that protective mechanisms may be recruited throughout the lifespan. Hence, simultaneously investigating the biological causes and reciprocal links between brain aging and neuropsychiatric disorders may provide novel perspectives on disease mechanisms. Accordingly, since evidence suggests that neural networks and biological mechanisms underlying mood regulation are specifically at risk across disorders and during aging, 6 our group has focused on major depression and aging of the brain, in order to investigate age-bydisease interactions. During our investigations of the molecular bases of major depression in the human postmortem brain, we have uncovered a large and robust effect of age on multiple genes and biological pathways. 7,8 Notably, this set of age-dependent genes broadly ov erlaps with diseaserelated pathways, and the changes in gene function observed during aging occur for the most part in directions that would otherwise promote neurological disorders, including depression. 8 For instance, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), somatostatin (SST) and other neuropeptides are decreased in mood-related [9][10][11][12][13][14] and neurodegenerative disorders, [15][16] but also lose ~50% expression during aging in control subjects. 7,17 Similar age and disease changes are observed for numerous other genes, 8,10 together suggesting that normal brain aging may in fact promote aspects of disease-related mechanisms. Indeed, major depression is associated with anticipated gene expression changes that occur during normal aging of the brain, 18 suggesting that an older molecular age of the brain may represent an early biological event in the disease process, and may serve as a useful marker for risk of developing symptoms of depression. This review summarizes findings and observations in support of an age-by-disease biological interaction model. This model brings together basic research on normal aging with the investigation of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases, and suggests that environment and genetic variability are contributing factors in defining risk and/or resiliency trajectories. Further, identifying age-dependent biological processes and their modulators may inform the development of new interventions for the prevention and treatment of a more broadly-defined depressive syndrome and for related functional outcomes in elderly subjects. Aspects of this model and hypothesis have been previously discussed elsewhere. 19,20 Depression and age-related functional outcomes\n\nAccording to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual Of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) , Major\n\nDepression is diagnosed in individuals experiencing low mood and/or anhedonia plus five symptoms that may include changes in sleep, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, low energy, poor concentration, changes in appetite, psychomotor retardation, and thoughts of death or suicide. 21 Defined this way, Major Depression affects 10% to 15% of people in the general population in their lifetime. 22 The biological bases of depression are complex and likely involve multiple interacting disruptions affecting neurons and glial cells within specific brain areas, giving rise to neural network dysfunctions and depressive symptomatology. At the molecular level there is com-pelling evidence for the involvement of many biological processes in depression, including, but not limited to , altered monoaminergic neurotransmission, altered stress hormone homeostasis, reduced neurotrophic support, metabolic dysregulation, immune reaction, increased inflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction, as well as other aspects of brain plasticity and synaptic functions. 23 Notably, similar changes have been reported during aging, prompting the hypothesis that major depression may be associated with \"accelerated aging\" (See Wolkowicz et al 4, 24 for reviews).\n\nOn the other hand, major depression and other mood disorders per se do not necessarily increase with age, and in fact, only approximately 1% of older individuals meet the criteria for major depression, a prevalence much lower than in younger individuals. 25 However, approximately 15% to 25% of individuals over the age of 65 experience depressive symptoms that, while not meeting criteria for major depression, do cause significant distress and interfere with daily functioning. 2,26 Low mood symptoms are also common in the presymptomatic phases of neurodegenerative disorders, and are often misattributed to general age-related morbidity. 27,28 This discrepancy between formal diagnosis and clinically significant depressive symptoms likely reflects the tendency of older individuals to underreport psychiatric symptoms, the predominance of vegetative and somatic symptoms as part of their clinical presentation, the inability to express depressive symptoms secondary to cognitive impairment, 29 and the possibility that depression in older individuals represents a different disease entity with unique clinical presentation and pathophysiology. 2,30 Although it is difficult to untangle causal relationships, evidence suggests that proper mood regulation-the capacity to exert homeostatic control on emotions over time-may represent a key component of late-life functional success, and conversely, that mood symptoms may represent not only an early marker, but also a potential contributing factor for subsequent spiraling functional declines. 31 Indeed, studies of the functional correlates of aging consistently report increased negative outcomes of low mood, 2 motor deficits ranging from decreased fine motor control to impairments in balance and gait, and continuous decline in certain aspects of cognitive functions. 32 This suggests that aspects of mood regulatory mechanisms may be selectively vulnerable to early homeostatic changes during normal and pathological aging, or that depressive symptoms may represent a common output for various underlying age-related brain declines. 30,33 Conversely, a proportion of older individuals are more resilient to the adverse effects of negative life events and are less likely to feel remorse and guilt, 2 underscoring the critical role of individual variability.\n\nAging of the brain\n\nThe number of individuals reaching age 65 in the United States rose 3-fold in the 20th century, from 4.1% in 1900 to 12.4% in the year 2000, and may rise above 20% by the middle of this century. This is equivalent to roughly 85 million people at current growth rates. 1 Despite its critical importance to a population growing older, \"normal\" brain aging and its association with late-life brain disorders is an understudied area of research. This is particularly apparent when compared with the investigation of neurodegenerative disorders, among other fields. The lack of attention given to this important topic may be due to the general belief that aging is inescapable, broadranging, and nonspecific. However, in recent years , the identification of single gene mutations affecting aging and longevity in nematodes, insects, and rodents has demonstrated the presence of a genetic program underlying aging, challenging the above assumptions. 34,35 In the mammalian brain, the course of aging parallels that of peripheral tissues, but additional mechanisms reflect the unique features of the brain and post-mitotic differentiated neurons. 19,36 For instance, the brain has a higher metabolism level than the rest of the body and utilizes a large proportion of consumed oxygen, hence increasing the potential for producing reactive oxygen species and subsequent oxidative stress. Oxidative stress mediates specific neuronal damage, including modifications to lipids, protein, and DNA, resulting in inflammation, an increase in reactive astrocytes, and altered Ca 2+ -and mitochondria-mediated neuronal functions, which together may contribute to the deterioration of mental capacities with age . 37,38 Further, with rare exceptions, neurons do not divide, 39 and thus cellular damage tends to accumulate with increasing age. This is paralleled by a decrease in the capacity for cellular repair. 36 Structurally, studies reveal a decrease in neuron volumes, a small loss or no change in cell numbers, 40,41 and a progressive thinning of cortical thickness, affecting both gray and white matter. 42,43 Functionally, studies indicate a continuous decline with age in certain aspects of cog-nitive functions (speed of processing, working memory, and long-term memory) beginning in the 20s. 44 In contrast, verbal knowledge increases throughout the lifetime. 32 This latter observation highlights the point that, while studies often demonstrate a negative conceptual bias towards aging, age-related changes can also be positive, and may represent the recruitment of protective mechanisms against known deleterious effects of aging (ie, oxidative stress) or uncharacterized and beneficial late brain-maturation processes. Based on the above observations, and supported by developments in gene array technology, our group 7,8 and others [45][46][47][48] have investigated the presence of age-dependent gene expression changes in the human brain, as molecular correlates of affected cellular functions.\n\n\"Molecular aging\" of the human brain\n\nIt has been known for some time that robust changes in gene expression occur with aging in peripheral tissues. 49 The fact that age-related changes in gene expression extend to the brain may not be surprising, given the body of knowledge about changes in structure and function of the brain with age (described briefly above). Indeed, one might hypothesize that age-related changes in gene expression reflect a general deterioration of the brain and that a preponderance of genes would be affected. This, however, does not appear to be the case. Recent genome-wide studies demonstrate that a relatively small number of genes exhibit age-dependent gene expression changes. Studies in rodent, monkey, and human brains estimate the number of genes exhibiting age-dependent changes to represent less than 10%, and commonly less than 5%, of the entire genome. 7,50-55 In a study from our group, the age-related changes of a large number of genes were investigated using gene microarray technology in prefrontal cortex samples from human subjects aged 13 to 79 years ( Figure 1). 7 The data from this study identified life-long progressive changes in expression with age in approximately 7.5% of genes tested, while expression levels for the large majority of genes were strikingly unchanged throughout adult life. This set of age-dependent genes was also very similar to those observed in other studies, and in fact displayed a high degree of conservation across cohorts and cortical brain regions, despite differences in sample size, expression platforms, and analytical methods. 7,8,[50][51][52]54,56,57 Together, this conserved and restricted scope of transcript changes sug-gests that specific cellular populations and biological processes are selectively affected during aging.

Continuous and pr ogressive gene expr ession changes in human prefrontal cortex. Age-dependent changes for a core set of exemplary genes (n=588) are presented together for two regions of the prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area (BA9), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; BA47, orbital ventral prefrontal cortex). Each gene is represented by a row, each array, or brain area per subject, by a column. Samples are organized left to right by brain area and increasing age. Green and red bars indicate decreased and increased gene expression, respectively, versus the averaged signal for these genes across all samples. For example, a horizontal row going from red to green indicates a gene for which expression decreases with age in that brain area. Genes are organized along the y-axis according to similarities in expression profiles across age. This study illus- ulation has now consistently been shown to be affected by aging across multiple studies. 19,36 Overall, age-upregulated genes are mostly of glial origin and related to inflammation and cellular defenses, while downregulated genes display mostly neuron-enriched transcripts relating to cellular communication and signaling (Figure 1). 7 The specificities of genes and cellular functions affected during aging of the brain are briefly summarized in Figure 2, and have been reviewed in detail elsewhere. 19,36 Together, the consistency and specificity of age-related changes fulfill criteria for aging biomarkers. Accordingly, we have shown that the predicted age for a particular individual, based on regression analysis of age-related trajectories for age-dependent genes, is highly correlated with the chronological age of that individual. 7,8 Hence, we have proposed the concept of \"molecular age\" (ie, predicted age, based on gene expression profile), as a functional assay to m easure biological aging of the brain and to assess individual deviation from chronological age and moderators of aging processes. 7,8 Using this assay, deviations from expected trajectories were also observed, in which individual subjects displayed greater or lower molecular ages compared with their chronological ages. These deviations did not covary with body mass index, sex, race, or death by cardiovascular accidents. Importantly, one could speculate that individuals with older or younger biological brains may ha ve displayed corresponding functional changes before death. Moreover, identifying factors underlying deviations either in molecular age or in sets of age-dependent genes (See section on BDNF and SST) may provide insight into modulators of age and age-by-disease interactions, hence providing targets for potential therapeutic approaches and preventive strategies. Modulators may include environmental components (diet, disease, exercise, drug exposure, etc), but evidence also suggests a genetic component into functional age trajectories . Here, before reviewing specificities of molecular aging in depression and potential genetic contributions, we review molecular aging and associated genes in the context of disease pathways.\n\nMolecular aging of the brain overlaps with biological pathways implicated in multiple brain disorders\n\nSpecific ages of onset are core features of many neuropsychiatric disorders, ranging from late-onset neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases 58 to earlier onset psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Yet, despite their importance, the mechanism(s) underly-ing age thresholds are largely unknown. Studies have shown that slowing normal aging in model organisms (through genetic or environmental means) results in delayed onset of age-related disorders. For example, mice hypermorphic for the longevity gene, Klotho, livẽ 20% longer and have a corresponding delay in onset of disease 59,60 and calorie-restricted primates demonstrated delayed incidence of diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and brain atrophy. 61 Together, these observations suggest an overlap between age-and disease-related biological pathways. Following a broad survey of genes affected during aging and in diseases, we have now reported a large over-representation of neurological-related genes within the human molecular signature of aging. 8 In fact, up to a third of genes affected during aging have also been associated in the literature with neuropsychiatric or other brain disorders. Conversely, only 4% of non-age-regulated genes are brain disease-related. For instance, age-and mood disorder-related genes include genes coding for neuropeptides (SST, NPY, CCK, CRF), trophic factors (BDNF, IGF1, FGF), receptors ( HTR2A, DRD1, CB1R, GABRAA5, FGF2R) and numerous other genes associated with diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders ( MAOB, PER3, CLU, SYN, HTT, NRG1, RLN, TAU, PARK, PINK1, NFKB, SOD2, RGS4, etc). 8 This observation that brain disorder-related genes are overrepresented among age-dependent genes, combined with the finding that the observed effects of aging on gene expression are mostly (>90%) in brain disorderpromoting directions, together suggest that the pathways to depression and other brain disorders in late life are aspects of normal molecular aging and may represent one mechanism by which aging precipitates their onset. Notably, these findings came from subjects who were free of neurodegenerative disorders, 8 so the observed changes were not sufficient to cause disorders. Instead, normal age-related changes in gene function may represent latent vulnerability factors that are promoted by aging, and that may directly contribute in the disease process (ie, causing or associated with disease) in the context of additional genetic and/or environmental risk factors, which exacerbate age-dependent trajectories. Conversely, moderating factors that delay age-dependent trajectories may promote resiliency not only against age-related declines but also against multiple brainrelated disorders.\n\nT r a n s l a t i o n a l r e s e a r c h \n\nMolecular interaction between depression and aging: the cases of BDNF, SST, and dendritic inhibition\n\nAn example of a putative interaction between age and disease is provided by the investigation of BDNF and BDNF-dependent genes. BDNF is a signaling neuropeptide that is critical during development and adulthood, specifically in maintaining plasticity and proper functioning of many targeted neuronal cells. Reduced BDNF levels and/or functions have been implicated in multiple brain-related disorders, including major depression, 10,13,14 bipolar depression, schizophrenia, Huntington's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. [9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16] Interestingly, BDNF is also downregulated with increasing age. A normal non-psychiatric control subject may lose as much as 60% of BDNF expression between the ages of 20 and 60 years. 7, 17 We have reported evidence of decreased BDNF levels and/or signaling in the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex of subjects affected with depression compared to controls. 10,14,62 We have also reported reduced expression of SST, cortistatin (CORT), and neuropeptide Y (NPY) in the same cohorts. SST, CORT, and NPY are neuropeptides that are expressed in subtypes of γaminobutyric acid (GABA) interneurons, which specifically target the dendrites of pyramidal neurons ( Figure  3a). SST, CORT, and NPY expressions are dependent on BDNF signaling, as demonstrated by reduced levels in mice with genetically-induced reduction in BDNF functions. 14,62,-63 Together, these findings have suggested the presence of a depression-related pathogenic mechanism linking reduced BDNF function to reduced markers of GABA interneurons that provide dendritic inhibition. Given that not all elderly subjects develop depression, additional factors must be at play. Indeed, the cross-sectional slope of decrease in BDNF expression in subjects with depression appears to parallel that of control subjects, but at a lower level, demonstrating reduced expression at most ages (Figure 3b). However, the fact that low expression in young depressed subjects overlaps with levels that are reached at older ages in control subjects demonstrates that low BDNF by itself is not sufficient.\n\nRather, this suggests that the molecular context of these reductions are critical contributing factors to developing pathophysiology. Notably, age-related changes for multiple BDNF-dependent genes, including SST, NPY, and to some extent CORT, display increasing rates of change with age compared with BDNF (ie, steeper slopes) and greater overall effect sizes in the context of depression (Figure 3c), 18 suggesting an age-by-disease interaction that further and negatively affects gene function in disease-promoting directions, in addition and potentially independently of changes in BDNF function. Together, these findings have suggested the presence of a BDNF/GABA-related biological module that is responsible for principal neuron dendritic inhibition, and that is positioned at the intersection of age and depression-related mechanisms. In this module, the interaction of both factors may potentially determine if and when decreased function reaches a certain threshold, under which pathophysiological output occurs. These findings also suggest three important aspects of a potential ageby-disease interaction: (i) age-dependent changes in expression of disease-related genes may represent latent vulnerability factors for diseases and associated symptom dimensions; (ii) BDNF and its associated agedependent changes may represent an upstream mediator for age-dependent changes of disease-related genes; and (iii) additional factors must be at play in establishing initial changes in upstream disease-related gene changes (ie, low BDNF) and in moderating the apparent \"acceleration\" of age-dependent trajectories in disease-promoting directions. Here, we next review additional findings relating to depression and accelerated aging, before discussing a broade r age-by-diseaseinteraction model.\n\nDepression is associated with \"accelerated\" molecular aging\n\nBased on the above-described putative interaction between age-and depression-related mechanisms affecting BDNF and BDNF-dependent genes, and in order to more formally test the hypothesis of accelerated aging in depression, we have investigated changes in broader patterns of age-dependent gene expression in the brains of individuals specifically affected with major depression. 18 Results confirmed that affected subjects showed greater changes for BDNF and BDNF-dependent gene expression than the normal age-related changes observed in control subjects. That study also reported that most depression-related genes were frequently ageregulated in both case and control subjects, and that the effects of major depression and age on individual genes were positively correlated. Conversely, most genes that were age-dependent in control subjects displayed greater age effects in subjects with major depression, and the increased prevalence of age effects in depression often corresponded to similar effects in controls , although of reduced magnitude and significance (ie , trend levels). This latter point suggested that the overall increase in number of age-affected genes in depressed subjects may not correspond to de novo age effects, but rather to amplified subthreshold events that were already present in control subjects. So, while that study provided molecular evidence in support of an accelerated brain aging hypothesis in depression, the observed combination of robust (eg, BDNF pathway) and more modest effects on different sets of genes and biological pathways also suggest a heterogeneous impact of age and disease effects on cellular functions. Alternatively, the molecular correlates of aging may represent variable sets of biological age-dependent events, each with their own mediators and modulators and with potential specificities in rates of age-related changes.\n\nProposed model for age-by-disease molecular interactions\n\nThe physiological and functional output of any biological system represents the integration of events occurring at the levels of genes, molecules, cells, microcircuits, and neural networks, and constant feedback across these biological scales contributes to the maintenance of homeostasis in the face of a changing environment. In the context of aging, it is not known which changes represent primary adaptive events that are necessary to maintain homeostasis, and which represent reactive processes and reduced capacity for repair against deleterious events, such as increased oxidative damage, inflammation and accumulation of damaged macromolecules, specifically affecting non-dividing neurons. However, the nature of age-dependent genes and the directions of their expression change with age strongly suggest that the human brain progressively moves with advancing age towards a state that is biologically more consistent with those observed in the context of neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders. 20 However, the relative rates of occurrence of psychopathology in elderly subjects also demonstrate that the age-dependent and disease-promoting changes in the expression of disease-related genes are not sufficient to induce overt pathophysiology and associated disease symptoms. For instance, extrapo-lating for studies in postmortem subjects , reduced BDNF, and markers of dendritic inhibition are probably common in many elderly subjects. One can speculate that these changes may actually be appropriate for the biological landscape of an elderly subject, but similar changes in a younger biological context may induce neural network dysfunctions and deficiencies in information processing and mood regulation, resulting in depression in midlife subjects, for instance. Hence, deviations from predicted trajectories and associated biological context may be more critical than expression changes per se. Based on these observations and supported by the fact that gene changes during aging occur in disease-promoting directions, our proposed model is that aging represents an intrinsic vulnerability to pathophysiological changes leading to symptom dimensions (eg, cognitive decline, low mood) and brain disorders, and that additional factors determine if and when critical pathophysiological thresholds are reached (Figure 4). More specifically, loss (or gain) of expression of disease-related genes below or outside expected trajectories and homeostatic range may mark the onset of cellular deficits, leading to disturbances in higher biological scales (microcircuitry, brain region, neural network), in turn promoting the onset of symptoms as the emerging properties of a deregulated system. In this model, factors that affect the trajectory of these age-related changes will determine the timing and potential severity of the initial molecular deficits (Figure 4). The identification of moderators, which place individuals on \"at-risk\" trajectories, may provide critical information on mechanisms of disease onset. Conversely, factors that delay age-related changes, or that place individuals on \"protected\" trajectories, may provide critical information on the nature of resiliency, and may offer insight into designing preventive strategies. In short, biological moderators of agedependent trajectories of gene function may represent candidate targets for therapeutic approaches and for promoting resiliency against brain disorders, including psychiatric disorders.\n\nImplications for future investigations of mechanisms of age and brain-related disorders\n\nEnvironmental and genetic factors are obvious candidate moderators of an age-by-disease interaction, but identifying their impact on biological aging of the brain may require new experimental strategies. Differences in molecular ages can be assessed in the mid-life range using postmortem brain samples (Figure 4, green shading) since molecular aging displays continuous, life-long, and mostly linear trajectories in adult subjects. 7,46 In contrast, when conducting studies to demonstrate associations of biological moderators with functional outcomes in live subjects, it is important to note that brain reserve capacity may buffer functional changes from occurring until years later. The presence of functional declines (emotionality, cognition, health) may be better assessed during later age periods of reduced reserve (ie, over 60\n\nto 65 years of age; Figure 4, yellow shading), where atrisk subjects may start experiencing variable rates of functional declines, while protected individuals may be experiencing more successful aging.\n\nIn view of the restricted scope of the molecular profile of aging (ie, less than 10% of expressed genes), studies of genetic factors affecting biological aging are predicted to reduce the number of candidate genes and associated DNA variants to reasonable levels for analytical purposes, hence addressing some of the problems of genome-wide association studies. In a proof-of-concept experiment, we have shown that individual subjects carrying a specific DNA variant located upstream from a candidate gene from the sirtuin family of longevityrelated genes (Sirtuin 5), 8 displayed increased molecular ages compared with carriers of the \"protective\" DNA variant, as measured in anterior cingulate cortex postmortem brain samples. These postmortem genetic studies will need to be followed by studies demonstrating associations of those DN A variants with putative changes in functional trajectories or with altered disease risk ratios in live subjects. Genetic associations with functional outcomes can be performed using resources from large-scale epidemiological studies, such as the health and body composition, cardiovascular health study or Framingham heart studies, which were specifically designed to investigate critical factors at the vigor-to-frailty age period. These studies may also facilitate the investigation of the moderating effects of the environment (ie , exercise, caloric restriction, nutritional factors such as antioxidants and omega-3 fatty acids, medication, etc), which are more difficult to assess in postmortem conditions due to smaller cohort sizes and reduced antemortem information.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, the considerable overlap between the molecular correlates of brain aging and biological pathways implicated in several neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, combined with the potential for a continuum of risk for psychopathology (or conversely resiliency) along life-long trajectories, together suggest a model for age-by-disease molecular interaction in which brain aging promotes biological changes associated with diseases.

Recientes caracterizaciones en los cambios en la expresión génica dependiente de la edad han mostrado que el envejecimiento del cerebro humano requiere de un conjunto específico de vías biológicas en un continuo a través del curso de toda la vida, y que los mismos genes que están asociados con el envejecimiento normal se implican frecuentemente y de igual forma en la depresión como en otros trastornos cerebrales. Estas sucesivas observaciones sugieren un modelo de interacciones moleculares de enfermedades por la edad, en las cuales el envejecimiento cerebral promueve cambios biológicos asociados con las enfermedades, y en forma adicional los factores ambientales y la variabilidad genética contribuyen a definir el riesgo de enfermar o de tener una evolución con resiliencia. En este artículo se revisan las características distintivas del envejecimiento cerebral en términos de cambios en la función génica a lo largo del tiempo, y luego se enfoca en la evidencia que sustenta un acelerado envejecimiento molecular en la depresión. Este modelo que propone la interacción biológica de enfermedades por la edad le da una dirección a la actual brecha en la investigación entre el envejecimiento cerebral \"normal\" y su conexión con enfermedades del final de la vida. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "annotations": {"sentence": null, "paragraph":

Attala", "Amelia A. Lake", "Emma L Giles"], "body": {"text": "\nPeople with a learning disability, who have a substantially reduced capability to understand new/complex information or live independently (Public Health England 2023), and individuals with a severe mental illness (SMI) (e.g., schizophrenia, psychoses, bipolar disorder or personality disorders) have a higher risk of living with overweight/obesity (Robertson et al. 2021;Bradshaw and Mairs 2014), which may be further compounded by medication (Brown et al. 2010;NHS England 2019). Furthermore, people with SMI/learning disability are at risk of dying 15-25 years earlier than the general population, often from obesity-related diseases (Robertson et al. 2021;Bradshaw and Mairs 2014). Indeed, health inequalities are well documented for people with SMI/learning disability, particularly around accessing a healthy diet and public services to help with weight management (The Kings' Fund 2024; Gov.uk 2022). \n\nDietitians have little pre-registration training on SMI or learning disability (Sloan and Frascina 2023;Ash et al. 2008;Shakespeare et al. 2009). Despite this being reported for many years, at the time of writing, the British Dietetic Association's (BDA) pre-registration framework does not specify SMI/ learning disability as areas dietitians should be taught (British Dietetic Association 2020). Furthermore, dietitians report a lack of training to conduct capacity assessments on diet/ health with patients with a learning disability (Sloan and Frascina 2023). \n\nAdditionally, the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC), the regulatory body for dietitians, stipulates several standards of proficiency, which relate to the dietitians' skills and knowledge required to support people with SMI/learning disability (Health and Care Professions Council 2023). However, lack of training may lead to a potential gap in dietitians' knowledge/skills when supporting people with SMI/ learning disability (Sloan and Frascina 2023;Ash et al. 2008;Shakespeare et al. 2009), making it difficult for dietitians to confidently and competently adhere to these standards (Caffrey 2023). \n\nThere is limited literature on the knowledge/skills of dietitians for supporting people with SMI/learning disability. Where evidence exists, dietitians are reported to have limited training in mental health and therefore lack the skills to support people with SMI/learning disability (Ash et al. 2008;Shakespeare et al. 2009). Furthermore, other healthcare professions also identify limited training and understanding for supporting people with SMI/learning disability, which may lead to poor patient outcomes and discrimination against this client group and therefore widen the health inequality gap in this population (Shakespeare et al. 2009;Alwar and Addis 2022;Giandinoto and Edward 2015;Ho et al. 2022). \n\nMoreover, the Equality Act (2010) recommends that reasonable adjustments are made for people with a disability (Government Equalities Office 2011). It is, therefore, important that services know if a patient has a disability, so they can be suitably supported (George et al. 2022). Yet, some hospitals do not routinely provide, audit or monitor the reasonable adjustments provided for people with SMI/learning disability, thus adding to the health inequality gap (Heslop et al. 2018). \n\nThere are no national referral criteria for AWM services as they are locally commissioned by Integrated Care Boards (Royal College of Surgeons of England 2014; Coxon 2023). However, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) suggests referring a person to specialist tier 3 AWM if they have obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m 2 ) along with 'complex disease states or needs that cannot be managed adequately in tier 2 (for example, the additional support needs of people with learning disabilities)' or when 'conventional treatment has been unsuccessful' (Public Health England 2017, 64). It is, therefore, likely that specialist AWM dietitians require the skills and knowledge to support patients with SMI/learning disability. \n\nThere is a lack of literature regarding the perceived knowledge/skills and service provision of specialist AWM dietitians for supporting people with obesity and SMI and/or learning disability. By using semi-structured interviews with specialist AWM dietitians in the NENC region, this study aimed to explore: (i) if specialist AWM dietitians feel they have the appropriate skills/knowledge to care for people with SMI/learning disability, (ii) what might enhance their skills/knowledge, (iii) whether specialist AWM services have the systems in place to care for people with SMI/learning disability and (iv) what might enhance their care. To our knowledge, this is the first study of its kind. \n\n| Methods\n\nA phenomenological approach was applied using semistructured interviews to explore the views and experiences of specialist AWM dietitians (Tong et al. 2007). To ensure appropriate study design and reporting, the consolidating criteria for reporting qualitative research (COREQ) tool was used (Tong et al. 2007). \n\nEthical approval was obtained by Teesside University and via the Integrated Research Application System (IRAS: 324599). The study gained Caldicott approval and sponsorship from Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust. Written consent was obtained prior to the interview. \n\nThe semi-structured interview was piloted (Majid et al. 2017;Aung et al. 2021) with a dietitian who previously worked in a specialist AWM service in the region. The interview was subsequently adapted by adding a question to explore the dietitian's experience around assessing capacity for diet/weight. All NHS Trusts in the NENC region with a specialist AWM service were sent an invitation to participate. The dietetics/AWM service lead of each unit was requested to forward an invitation email with the participant information sheet to the relevant dietitians. The dietitians were invited to contact the interviewer (AA) directly to express an interest in participating and arrange a mutually suitable interview time. \n\nThe interviews were conducted using Microsoft Teams in July 2023 (Khan and MacEachen 2022;Braun et al. 2017). Participants were interviewed once, and transcripts were not returned to participants for review (Birt et al. 2016); however, participants had access to their video recording until transcription was completed. \n\nTo allow a relevant clinical discussion on how the dietitian might support an individual with obesity, SMI and mild learning disability, part of the semi-structured interview invited the dietitians to consider a case study, which was developed for the study, or a patient under their care (Attala et al. 2023). The dietitians were asked to rate their confidence in supporting the patient, whereby 1 = no confidence and 10 = highly confident. The reported rating is referred to as their 'confidence score'. \n\nThe interviews were recorded and initially transcribed by Microsoft Teams; subsequently transcribed ad verbatim by the interviewer (AA). The recordings, which only the participant and interviewer (AA) could view, were deleted after transcription. Analysis and coding of the transcriptions were performed using a single coder: the interviewer (AA) (Keene 2023). \n\nThis study was undertaken as part of a Clinical Research MRes. The interviewer (AA) is an experienced, female dietitian, working as the Lead Dietitian in a specialist AWM service in the North-East of England. The participants were informed of this in the participant information sheet. To improve study trustworthiness, the questions were open and brief fieldnotes were kept reflecting upon what went well/did not in the interview (Tessier 2012). AA has previous experience of conducting semistructured interviews and was supervised by a wider research team experienced in qualitative methods, thus ensuring reliability (Pizzolato and Dierickx 2023). \n\nDescriptive statistics were used to outline participants' experience. The interview transcripts were transcribed ad verbatim, analysed, and coded by AA both manually and using Nvivo (Lumivero NVivo Pro 12, 2019 www. lumiv ero. com) (Braun and Clarke 2022). Thematic analysis was used to analyse the data (Braun et al. 2017). \n\n| Results\n\nDietitians from five of the six possible NHS Trusts responded to participate. The interviews lasted an average of 49 min (range: 37-65 min). Most participants were in a quiet room on their own. Two participants (P6 and P8) took part while in shared offices; however, they used headphones, were able to speak freely and were not interrupted. \n\nA total of eleven dietitians expressed an interest in participating. Using purposeful sampling (Silverman 2010;Guest et al. 2006) to ensure a range of genders, dietetic experience, experience of working in AWM and NHS Trusts, a total of nine dietitians were interviewed. Two dietitians were not selected as it would have over-represented a Trust with an integrated tier3/tier 4 service, which is only available for those who want to be considered for bariatric surgery (Smith 2024). To ensure anonymity, no further information can be given about this Trust (Dougherty 2021). The interviews proceeded until no further themes emerged; thus, data saturation was perceived to have been achieved (Guest et al. 2006;Braun and Clarke 2021). \n\nMany of the dietitians interviewed were experienced and had worked in AWM services for some time. Most of the dietitians worked part-time (0.2-0.9 whole time equivalent) in the specialist AWM service (Table 1), with other roles in bariatrics, diabetes and care homes. \n\n| University Training and Post-Qualification Courses\n\nThere was a relatively even split between those qualifying from an English University (n = 5; 56%) and a Scottish University (n = 4; 44%). Two individuals, who qualified less than 4 years ago from an English University, had some taught component on SMI/learning disability on their Dietetics course. Although from the same university, the amount of input was variable, with one dietitian receiving half a module on mental health, which mainly consisted of eating disorders; the other dietitian had 2 days of external speakers whilst on placement (a day on mental health and 1 day on learning disability). They found their education on SMI/learning disability useful and transferable to their current practice. \n\nTwo dietitians, who qualified from Scottish Universities (over 5 years ago), experienced working with people with SMI/learning disability for 2-6 weeks whilst on placement. None of the dietitians who qualified in England had any placement experience of working with people with SMI or learning disability. \n\n| Confidence in Supporting an Individual With SMI and/or Learning Disability\n\nUsing a case study of a male with obesity, SMI and mild learning disability, participants were asked to rate their confidence  to support him, whereby 1 = no confidence and 10 = highly confident. The dietitians' 'confidence-score' ranged from 4 to 7.5, with an average 'confidence-score' of 5.8 (Table 2). Those who gave a range of 'confidence-scores', for example: 4-5, the middle score was used that is, 4.5. Two individuals lowered their 'confidence-score' during the interview, one due to lack of accessible resources for weight management: 'confidence-score' dropped from 6 to 4-5; and one in relation to a discussion about capacity assessments on weight/diet: 'confidence-score' dropped from 7 to 2. However, their original rating was used to calculate the average and range 'confidence-scores'. \n\nParticipants attending the BDA's 'Introduction to mental health course' (blue) and experience of mental health/learning disability on student placement (orange), appear to have slightly higher 'confidence-scores'. However, this did not appear to be the case for those who had been taught mental health whilst at university (green) (Table 2). Each theme has at least one illustrative quote. An ellipsis (…) is used for omitted words and square brackets are used for the researcher's comments to clarify the meaning/context of the quote. \n\n| Theme 1: Training and Education\n\nTraining was perceived as the main area that could increase the dietitians' confidence to support people with SMI/learning disability. All the participants felt they lacked training and had little/no education on the subject while at university or post-qualification. \n\nWe've not been trained. I don't think it was even mentioned at Uni (P2) Some dietitians suggested training on SMI was important due to the link between physical and mental health. Furthermore, it was perceived that a significant proportion of patients referred to specialist AWM services have a mental health diagnosis. \n\n…there's a lot of links….with the gut and the brain… so it makes sense for us to have training in mental health, when we know there's such a strong link between the two conditions [physical and mental health] (P1) …that's a frightening thing, most of our patients coming through -there's 'something' [a mental health diagnosis], and yet our knowledge is still so lacking (P3) \n\nMost of the dietitians were unaware of any post-qualification training for dietitians on supporting people with SMI/learning disability. \n\nWe were having this conversation in clinic the other day -about what sort of training is available and we weren't sure what there was or how to access it (P8) \n\nTwo dietitians were aware of the BDA's 'Introduction to mental health' course, having attended it whilst in different posts. \n\nThere was a mixed reaction to the course content. One felt it was too basic, focusing too much on eating disorders. Yet, the other recalled it as an awareness session for all dietitians, not just mental health specialists. \n\nIt was quite an eating disorder focused one, there wasn't much on learning disabilities (P9) \n\nA lot of it was around awareness…it was for any dietitian (P4) Some dietitians had completed their Trust's mandatory training on learning disability. However, the lack of training on SMI was believed to contribute to poor confidence in this area. \n\nOur Trust has just launched a mandatory training module for learning disabilities…it was brilliant. But in terms of severe mental illness no not at all. In fact, I'm even less confident with that (P5) The participants offered suggestions on topics they would find helpful to be trained on, for example, mental health conditions, medication, and appropriate communication (Table 3). \n\n|\n\n| Theme 2: Resources\n\nThe dietitians felt the lack of easy-read/accessible resources was also a contributory factor for poor confidence in supporting a patient with poor literacy. When the participants were asked to rate their confidence in supporting people with SMI/learning disability, one participant lowered their 'confidence score' upon the realisation there was a lack of accessible resources available in AWM ('confidence score' reduced from 6 to 4-5). \n\nI One dietitian had searched for accessible resources, but with little success. Another had a support worker in their service who was their Trust's learning disability link-champion and was therefore aware of some easy-read/accessible resources. However, they were uncomfortable about the language used in them. \n\nThere were some other resources which I thought were absolutely fantastic…specifically for learning disability -so very un-pc terms…I think one of them was 'So do you want to be fat?' (P5) \n\n| Theme 3: Service Provision\n\nMany respondents felt their specialist AWM service was insufficiently equipped to support people with SMI and/or learning disability. Furthermore, it was perceived that poor service provision may lead to potential inequalities. \n\nI don't think as a service we're very good at adapting things (P2) \n\n…giving them [patients with additional needs] a separate pathway…because…we treat everybody equally, but we'll talk about health inequalities, don't we?…they obviously need different…requirements (P7) \n\nHowever, despite feeling service provision and adaptation was poor, most respondents reported making some adjustments to support individuals who may require it. It was perceived that some people with a learning disability might need this. Adjustments were mainly in the form of additional clinic time, more frequent appointments, offering one-to-one support rather than group work, or face-to-face appointments rather than telephone. However, it was felt this level of support was timeconsuming and was not feasible to support large numbers and may be viewed negatively by managers, who were perceived to prefer waiting lists to be reduced. \n\nA normal clinic appointment just is nowhere near enough time to go through the information and what we found is she gets really overwhelmed with too much information, so she was in clinic next week and the week after and that's kind of taking up a lot of time…-obviously we've got a lot of demand and… it feels like maybe your time's not accounted for as it would be if you were getting through the waiting list…because you're spending so much time with one patient (P1) \n\nIt was perceived that the consultation environment was also something that should be considered for some people. However, it was acknowledged that this was potentially difficult to change or control. \n\n…making sure the setting that they feel comfortable in. But I suppose that's the only setting that we have (P8) \n\nOur…[AWM service] see patients in a hall…I think for someone who's…over stimulated and/or…has sensory issues…it probably wouldn't be appropriate at all. I would imagine it would be quite overwhelming for them (P1) \n\nLack of time, poor funding, and long waiting lists were given as factors for not being able to provide more support for people with SMI/learning disability. \n\nAll of these services are so stretched (P3) \n\n| Referrals to Adult Weight Management Services.\n\nPoor quality and insufficient documentation on referrals to specialist AWM services was regarded as problematic. \n\nAdditionally, it was suggested some people may appear to be more 'complex' on paper than in real life. The dietitians believed there had been an increase in referrals of individuals with a diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) and/or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and felt ill-equipped to support patients with these conditions. \n\nIt\n\nWhat I am seeing a significant increase of -in my own perception -would be people with the ADHD diagnosis…and autism (P5) \n\nAt BOMSS [British Obesity and Metabolic Surgery Society conference], one of the lectures was on neurodivergence…and…we were like, yeah, this is becoming more and more apparent. And actually, we don't have the skills or the knowledge to be managing this (P3) \n\n….autism's, probably one that I'm less familiar of any specific dietary advice (P9) \n\n| Service\n\nImprovements. There were some suggestions for service improvements, such as creating a pathway for people with a learning disability, ensuring a consistent healthcare professional and providing training for support workers. \n\nI think probably having a pathway that would be more of a one-to-one approach for them [patients with additional needs], rather than in a group setting would be…helpful. We do have the option for that, but…it's…not a definite pathway (P8) \n\n| Theme 4: Networking and External Influences\n\nHaving a professional support network was identified as another potential means of increasing dietitians' confidence in supporting people with SMI/learning disability. Often the main sources of support were from colleagues with more experience in mental health, for example, the service psychologist(s). \n\nWe've got a very supportive psychology team and I think if it wasn't for them, then that number [confidence-score] would have been definitely far less (P7) \n\nIt was believed support from local mental health Trusts and/ or more experienced colleagues, through clinical supervision, would be useful. Dietitians working in mental health were regarded as the experts on SMI/learning disability, and the specialist AWM dietitians wanted more support and to network with them. Some specialist AWM dietitians had made links with local mental health dietitians to support specific patients, finding the dietitians working in mental health to be very supportive, providing the patient was under joint care. However, it was also viewed that there was possibly a lack of joined-up working at times. There was a sense specialist AWM services occasionally accepted referrals for individuals/conditions which ought to be excluded from the service. However, it was felt there was no alternative support/service for that person if the referral was declined. Equally, it was perceived this might not always be best for the person, and on occasion might even be detrimental. \n\nTechnically everyone with learning disabilities is outside of our referral criteria, but we make \n\n| Theme 5: Assessment\n\nNone of the dietitians had experience of, or felt equipped to, conduct a capacity assessment for weight/diet. Nobody felt confident in this area, with one dietitian saying they would drop their 'confidence-score' from 7 to a 2 if they had to think about a capacity assessment. Indeed, some dietitians had not thought of assessing capacity for diet/weight with some of their patients. \n\nMy confidence for capacity assessment would be very low, like a 2 (P9) I'll be honest, I wouldn't think of doing that [assessing capacity] with a patient with a learning disability (P5) \n\nThere were mixed feelings about conducting capacity assessments for weight/diet. Some dietitians felt it would be useful to know how to do one, or at least have the awareness of what was involved. Others felt it was beyond their scope of practice. Some dietitians were uncomfortable about capacity assessments for diet/weight, feeling assessing capacity might be regarded as prejudiced. However, it was appreciated that assessing capacity for diet/weight was potentially an important aspect of patient care and, in some instances, safety. \n\nif we [are] deeming that patient doesn't have capacity we're in a position where we're gonna sort of withdraw food to an extent -for their health…I feel…quite uncomfortable with that…but it's about best interests isn't it? And I suppose if…the patient's eating themselves to a point where they're extremely unwell…then that is what needs to happen. I don't know. I don't know why I feel uncomfortable about it, to be honest. I just…it feels like a higher level of something that we should do (P4) …we're…always so worried…about…being prejudiced against somebody, but actually sometimes it's about -we've got to take it back to patient safety, haven't we? (P3) \n\nWhilst the AWM dietitians did not perceive that they knew much about capacity assessments, many of them had an understanding of the complexity of capacity. \n\nAnd there's so many steps to…capacity like someone being able to…understand the information and then interpret it and then come to a decision and then communicate that back to you (P6) \n\nLack of experience in conducting capacity assessments for diet/ weight was regarded as the reason for poor knowledge and confidence in the area. Being able to assess capacity for diet/weight was thought to be important, and the dietitians would like to have training on it. \n\n…absolutely appropriate that we should be trained on that [capacity assessments] (P5) \n\nDespite the dietitians' belief they did not have the skills and knowledge to assess capacity for diet/weight, the majority reported they would want to assess an individual with SMI/learning disability, before deciding upon treatment. Being able to assess an individual was also viewed as something that would increase the dietitian's confidence. \n\n…there's such a varying degree of -you know there's the diagnosis on paper -but it's really important to do that assessment yourself rather than making an assumption of what a patient may need (P8) I think I'd feel more supported if we were able to spend more time to understand the patient before seeing them (P2) \n\n| Theme Six: Compassion & Self-Efficacy\n\nAll the dietitians showed compassion, wanted to do the best for the individual and to provide a good service, despite their perceived limitations. When they believed they were providing a poor service, they felt they were failing the individual and their caregivers. This made the dietitians feel they were providing sub-standard dietetic care. \n\nI felt like I was absolutely failing that patient (P2) \n\nI felt like a…bad dietitian that day (P1) I think it's just a confidence of knowing, you know, are we…are we doing the best for this patient? (P5) I guess if someone looks a bit panicked [when asked to set their own goal], you feel awful (P6) \n\nThe dietitians described sometimes feeling 'stuck' and were not able to apply techniques taught during training, such as goal setting and motivational interviewing. It was perceived that these techniques may make the patient uncomfortable, but also made the dietitian feel they had not supported the patient sufficiently. \n\nIn Uni, we were always…encouraged…to get patients…setting their own goals and taking the lead. And when I first…tried that approach with… the first few patients that I had with…severe mental illness or learning disabilities…I just got a sense they felt a bit…put on the spot or -it just didn't feel comfortable (P6) I've definitely have that in clinic before, when I've felt quite stuck and…I don't know what else to suggest (P2) \n\nIt was believed weight management might not be a priority for someone experiencing a decline in mental health. Indeed, focusing on weight whilst mental health was unstable was viewed as having a possible negative impact on the individual. Additionally, dietitians thought some patients and caregivers can hold unrealistic expectations about weight loss. Dietitians found having these types of conversations difficult. The dietitians also perceived if the service provision given was incorrect/ inadequate, not only could it make the dietitian feel awkward, but it could also be detrimental to the patient. \n\nI think the main areas I've struggled with is where someone's mental health is so severe that they're not able to engage or change or that we feel…it's… detrimental to their mental health because…clearly -it's not the priority-and it's not the right thing to do (P9) \n\nI think it would be very detrimental to send them [the patient] into a workshop [a group session] and it not be suitable for them. That might just make them feel a lot worse (P4) \n\nThis research aimed to explore the views of specialist AWM dietitians in the NENC region regarding their skills and service provision for supporting people with obesity and SMI and/or learning disability. To our knowledge, this is the first UK study focusing on non-mental health dietitians' perspectives on this issue. \n\nThis study corroborates Australian studies, which report dietitians lack sufficient knowledge, skills, or training on mental health during pre-registration training (Ash et al. 2008;Teasdale et al. 2023;Humphries et al. 2012). Training on SMI/learning disability varied, with some dietitians receiving education while others did not. This is likely to broaden the health inequalities gap seen in this population (FitzPatrick et al. 2021). \n\nDietitians reported varying levels of confidence for supporting people with SMI/learning disability, with confidence linked more to experiences than to formal training. This aligns with other studies (Buttenshaw et al. 2017;Ash et al. 2008). Despite this, all the dietitians believed additional training would enhance their skills and confidence, especially pre-qualification and through post-qualification updates. Such education could raise awareness, reduce discrimination and address health inequalities (Alwar and Addis 2022;Giandinoto and Edward 2015;Ho et al. 2022;FitzPatrick et al. 2021). \n\nThe dietitians expressed an interest in collaborating with mental health for training, supervision, resource sharing and support. They viewed mental health dietitians as experts in supporting people with SMI/learning disability. However, some believed mental health Trusts may not support individuals with obesity, leaving specialist AWM services supporting individuals who may not meet referral criteria and subsequently may be insufficiently supported. \n\nAccessible, easy-read resources for people with obesity and poor literacy were perceived as lacking, undermining the dietitians' confidence. The BDA mental health specialist group was seen as potentially having useful resources, but membership fees were seen as limiting access and contributing to health inequalities. \n\nThe dietitians were aware of the stigma and health inequalities experienced by people with SMI/learning disability (Corrigan and Watson 2002;Heslop et al. 2014;Ditchman et al. 2013); as were they aware of the weight stigma people with obesity experience (Jackson 2016;World Obesity 2022). Having a 'doublestigma' for obesity and SMI/learning disability could leave the person feeling unsupported, worsening mental health and increased obesity; contributing to barriers for accessing healthcare (Mizock 2015). The dietitians were keen to avoid discrimination and reduce health inequalities. \n\nDietitians recognise the link between mental health and physical health, particularly around weight management (Ohrnberger et al. 2017; Centre for Mental Health 2023a). They noted the challenge of managing long-term health conditions for people with SMI/learning disability, who require support for both their physical and mental health (Public Health England 2018; Centre for Mental Health 2023b). \n\nThe AWM dietitians reported stretched services due to limited funding, staffing and long waiting lists, a common issue across the NHS (Buse et al. 2022;NHS Confederation 2021). \n\nThe dietitians believed that some services referred their patients to AWM services to reduce their own waiting lists, which sometimes led to care for people often excluded from their other services. Furthermore, whilst the specialist AWM dietitians made some reasonable adjustments to accommodate those with increased requirements, it was perceived that management would prefer waiting lists to be reduced. Other studies recommend a cultural shift is required by management to improve the care of people with additional needs, along with audits to highlight this issue (Witham et al. 2014;van Daalen et al. 2021). \n\nThe dietitians felt referrals to AWM were often incomplete, lacking details on patients' mental health or communication needs, which could impact care (Kripalani et al. 2007). Clinical triage was seen as essential for needs to be met (Johnson et al. 2018). \n\nThere was also concern that some healthcare professionals pressure people with SMI/learning disability to lose weight, which may not be realistic, due to the impact of many antipsychotics (Bak et al. 2014); an issue highlighted by other authors (Teasdale et al. 2023). \n\nThere was a perception of increased referrals to specialist AWM services of people with ASD and/or ADHD. It is unclear whether this was due to an increase in diagnoses of these conditions (Underwood et al. 2022;Russell et al. 2022), or if referrals had just increased. \n\nThe dietitians felt ill-equipped to support people with these conditions, as many individuals also have obesity (Cortese 2019;Zheng et al. 2017;Dhaliwal et al. 2019). Further research around the perceived increase in referrals of people with ASD and/or ADHD to specialist AWM would be of interest. \n\nThe recent HCPC standards for dietitians stipulate being 'able to obtain valid consent' and 'importance of capacity in the context of delivering care and treatment' (Health and Care Professions Council 2023, 2). Yet, none of the dietitians interviewed had been trained on how to assess capacity for weight/diet. Nevertheless, they gauged understanding and adapted their approach to individual needs. The authors acknowledge that since this study was completed, the BDA is now providing a course on capacity for diet, weight and health (British Dietetic Association 2023). \n\nIn conclusion, this study demonstrates that NENC region AWM dietitians are compassionate and committed to providing a good service for people with obesity and SMI/learning disability. However, their conscientiousness can lead to negative emotions they have if they believe they have failed the patient (Gordon 2022). \n\n| Limitations\n\nThe researcher (AA) works as the Lead AWM Dietitian for one of the participating Trusts. However, she does not line-manage staff, but provides clinical supervision. She has worked for several years in specialist AWM in the region and is known by many of the participants. Whilst this may have helped with recruitment and open discussions, it may have led to some bias (Aburn et al. 2021;Berkovic et al. 2020). However, fieldnotes were kept highlighting/minimising these issues (Tessier 2012). \n\nOne NHS Trust did not respond, thus not all Trusts in the area were represented. A relatively small purposive sample of dietitians (n = 9) was selected; however, by the seventh interview, no new information was emerging; hence, data saturation was perceived to have been achieved. To comply with ethics and ensure participant anonymity, detailed information regarding the participants/participating NHS Trusts cannot be disclosed (Kaiser 2009;UK Statistics Authority 2022). \n\nThis study only explored the views of dietitians working in specialist AWM services in the NENC region. Whilst it is likely other specialist AWM services, and dietitians in other specialties, experience the same as the participants in this study, further research is required to confirm this. \n\nThe authors were unable to verify if mental health Trusts are less likely to support people with obesity; further studies are required to confirm this. Moreover, it would be of interest to obtain a patient perspective on their care and support with their obesity and SMI/learning disability. \n\n| Conclusions/Recommendations\n\nThere are clear implications for practice. Dietitians and all healthcare professionals would benefit from training to understand both physical and mental health, as often they coexist (Ohrnberger et al. 2017;Centre for Mental Health 2023a). This may help to improve dietitians' confidence and skills and reduce stigma for those with SMI/learning disability, thus improving patient care and narrowing the health inequality gap (Shakespeare et al. 2009;Alwar and Addis 2022;Giandinoto and Edward 2015;Ho et al. 2022;FitzPatrick et al. 2021). \n\nTraining on and the availability of accessible resources for weight management would be beneficial. Furthermore, training, supervision and linking between mental health and acute dietitians may improve clinician confidence and skills (Teasdale et al. 2023;Buttenshaw et al. 2017). The BDA may wish to take the lead on these issues: ensuring all dietitians receive education on SMI, learning disability, ADHD and ASD, particularly during pre-registration. The BDA may wish to ensure that training post-registration is also targeted to non-mental health dietitians, along with sharing/developing accessible resources on obesity and networking between specialist groups. \n\nThere is a desire to support individuals with additional needs within specialist AWM services. However, whilst these services are somewhat able to adapt for those with additional needs, there is a limit to what can be done under the current conditions. Specialist AWM services are stretched and underfunded (NHS Confederation 2021). Alternative pathways for people with obesity and additional requirements may be of benefit. More comprehensively completed referrals and additional funding may facilitate this.

Many real applications require agents that can navigate open worlds that evolve over time (Boult et al., 2019). Designing effective agents for these domains requires the ability to detect, characterize, and ultimately adapt to novel stimuli. \n\nPublished in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (03/2023) To define novelty, we take the point of view of an agent with some prior experience in a given environment. We define a stimuli as novel to the agent if it considerably differs from the agent's model (Ruff et al., 2021). Some authors refer to similar problems as anomaly detection or out-of-distribution detection. Novelties are not simply outliers. Detecting a novelty suggests that revising the agent's model is necessary, whereas an outlier is a rare event expected (however infrequently) under the existing model. \n\nWork on novelty detection has spanned decades (Markou & Singh, 2003;Pimentel et al., 2014;Ruff et al., 2021), with a wealth of available paradigms spanning \"one-class\" boundary learning (Schölkopf et al., 2000), reconstruction error (Abati et al., 2019), probabilistic density modeling (Nalisnick et al., 2018), and more. For vision-based novelty detection, recent progress has been dominated by modifications of deep image classifiers (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017;Liang et al., 2018;Cheng & Vasconcelos, 2021). \n\nDespite this wealth of methods, evaluation practices have seen less attention. Recent visual novelty detection systems are typically evaluated by repurposing object-focused datasets such as Caltech-256 (Griffin et al., 2007) or CIFAR-10 (Krizhevsky, 2009) that were originally intended for supervised classification. A typical evaluation paradigm trains on a \"normal\" subset of available classes, then tries to detect \"novel\" images from other classes unseen during training. We contend that when using object-focused datasets, this paradigm is too optimistic, representing best-case scenarios where the object is relatively large and well-framed within the image. While some efforts have turned toward fine-grained classification datasets like distinguishing novel breeds of dogs (Cheng & Vasconcelos, 2021), these images remain object-focused. To develop agents ready to navigate open worlds, we argue that a scene-focused benchmark is needed. \n\nWe have developed and released a comprehensive scene-focused dataset that we call NovelCraft, for benchmarking systems that can detect and adapt to novelty in open worlds. Our target domain is a modified Left: Images from two normal episodes (rows 1-2) and two novel episodes (rows 3-4). Detection is challenging as only a few images in novel episodes actually contain novel objects, here outlined in orange when visible. Right: Example symbolic information available at each frame. At each frame, we record a complete JSON representation of the player state and all objects and artificial agents in the world (x,z,y position in 3D, orientation, etc.). This includes objects outside the player's view recorded in images. \n\nStandard Episodes\n\nversion of Minecraft that provides a complex, colorful 3D world with a pixelated video game aesthetic. Within this world, the agent's goal is to use a carefully selected sequence of actions to turn available resources into a pogo stick. We have recorded the observations of an artificial agent running through hundreds of episodes of this pogo stick construction task, each one producing a sequence of images as well as non-visual symbolic information about the world's state (including all objects, not just those visible from agent's current viewpoint). In some of these episodes, the game has been deliberately modified so that novel types of objects (e.g. TNT explosives, fences, or jukeboxes) are inserted into the world and potentially visible to the agent. Some of these novel objects can impact gameplay (e.g. trees with distinct bark color may yield more resources). Representative images from two \"normal\" episodes and two \"novel\" episodes are shown in Fig. 2, visualizing how novel objects vary in placement and size in complex scenes. \n\nUsing this data, we define three benchmark tasks. First, we have two flavors of novelty detection: (1) using vision (Sec. 4), and (2) using non-visual symbolic or multimodal information (Sec. 5). Next, we consider (3) characterization of novelty via a category discovery task (Sec. 6) where the system must find new objects within complex scenes and organize them within an ever-growing system of classes. We benchmark how state-of-the-art methods perform at each task. \n\nThe contributions of this study are:\n\n1. A scene-focused dataset purpose-built for visual novelty detection. Existing evaluations are too object-focused, artificially creating \"novelty\" by repurposing images designed for object classification. In Sec. 4, we benchmark visual detectors on our new data of complex scenes containing many objects, with novelties often found in the periphery or occluded by other objects when the agent first encounters them. 2. Inclusion of two useful modalities: images and symbolic world-state. In Sec. 5, we show how our data supports visual as well as non-visual symbolic processing to detect novelties. Our dataset can be used to prototype multimodal methods, which are thus far under-explored in the literature. 3. Examination of metrics informed by task-specific costs. While we do report widely used areaunder-curve scores to assess detectors, we contend that reporting only these metrics ignores the need to pick a threshold when the system must produce binary decisions. Threshold selection must be guided by the task-specific costs of false positives versus false negatives in any deployment. 4. Going beyond detection, we assess category discovery. The ability to recognize a previously seen novelty is necessary for an agent to improve with more experience. In Sec. 6, we show how our dataset can be used to inspire improvements in generalized category discovery and share code and pretrained model for generalized category discovery. \n\nUltimately, we hope our work is a step toward a long-term goal of agents that fuse vision with other sensors to adapt to open worlds. Our primary motivation is not one specific real application (like self-driving cars) but rather a general style of problem-solving that we think will become increasingly common and useful: the integration of vision systems for complex scenes within the overall cognitive architectures of a goal-oriented agent to successfully adapt to novelty in 3D open worlds over time. \n\nRationale for focus on a virtual world. We specifically selected this Minecraft-like world because it has several key attributes that are helpful toward our long-term goal. First, it requires long-range planning over time toward a clear goal (pogo stick assembly), not just immediate stimuli-driven responses (e.g. avoid an obstacle in the road). Second, gameplay in this world allows interaction with other agents (both beneficial and adversarial). Third, gameplay requires reasoning about a combinatorial action space as well as 3D movement (vertical or horizontal). Our current benchmark and this research field in general are not at the finish line, only a few steps into a longer journey. We posit that our dataset and evaluation practices are a useful step forward, and the virtual platform we build upon can grow towards this goal. \n\nRelated Work on Datasets for Novelties and Anomalies\n\nObject-focused datasets. Datasets showcasing distinct object types, such as CIFAR-10, Caltech-256, and ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009), originally intended for supervised classification, are often repurposed to assess novelty detection under a k-classes-out paradigm (Ruff et al., 2021). This approach continues to dominate vision research related to novelty detection: The Open World Vision workshop at CVPR 2021 used repurposed images from ImageNet in their open-set recognition challenge (Kumar et al., 2021). Some recent efforts use synthetic perturbations of ImageNet images to assess robustness (Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019) and separate novelties based on the level of semantic similarity to the training classes (Vaze et al., 2021). Many recent novelty detection methods, such as work by Cheng & Vasconcelos (2021), have yet to be evaluated on scenes, where novelties may not be large, centered or fully visible in the images. \n\nScene-focused datasets. Some recent work has developed datasets that could be used to assess novelty or anomalies in complex visual scenes. The Common Objects in Context (COCO-2014) dataset (Lin et al., 2014) is a widely-used benchmark for scene understanding containing complex images gathered from Flickr, but was not intended to assess novelty detection or discovery. The UBnormal dataset (Acsintoae et al., 2022) contains fixed perspective videos of complex virtual scenes designed to contain anomalous events. Several efforts look at anomalies in scenes gathered from autonomous driving, such as Fishyscapes (Blum et al., 2021) or Road Anomaly (Lis et al., 2019;Chan et al., 2021). NovelCraft is complementary to other scene-focused datasets as some methods may not want to try to overcome the challenge of NovelCraft's severe class imbalance or aim for collaboration with an agent instead of a more typical classification setting. To our knowledge there are no scene-focused datasets that are class-balanced by default, but datasets larger than NovelCraft could more easily be split into subsets to obtain class balancing without reducing performance significantly. A class balanced setting can be more practical for applications where the deployment environment is more controlled, such as robots deployed in a warehouse. UBnormal (Acsintoae et al., 2022) 2019) explore open long-tailed recognition of not-so-common object categories representing the \"long tail\" using a repurposed view of the scene-focused Places dataset (Zhou et al., 2018). Lin et al. (2021) introduce the CLEAR benchmark for continual learning on scene-focused internet images from 2004-2014. Other works explore open-world instance segmentation, either on the COCO dataset (Saito et al., 2022) or on images collected from cars on the road (Chan et al., 2021). Compared to these works, our dataset is distinct in its multimodality and how images are gathered over time by a navigating agent. \n\nRelated Minecraft datasets.\n\nVery recent parallel work has developed the MineDojo benchmark framework (Fan et al., 2022) The virtual world we build upon (with permission from the creators) is PolyCraft2 , a modification of the videogame MineCraft developed by a research team at UT-Dallas (Smaldone et al., 2017;Goss et al., 2023). \n\nPolycraft is multi-purpose software with several applications. We use a particular environment, PolyCraft POGO. \n\nWithin the Polycraft POGO environment, an agent is tasked with exploring a 3-dimensional voxel world via a sequence of actions such as move, break, or craft. Completing the task requires the agent to execute a plan roughly 60 actions long. Moving the agent any distance requires only a single action, so many actions involve the agent interacting with an object or another environment-controlled agent. The agent's goal is to create a pogo stick from resources, such as wood and rubber, that must be gathered from the environment. A solution to the task requires the agent to break trees to acquire wood, craft the wood into planks and sticks, move to a work bench, use the work bench to craft the planks and sticks into a tree tap, place the tree tap adjacent an unbroken tree, use the tree tap to acquire rubber, move to a work bench, and use the work bench to craft rubber, planks, and sticks into a pogo stick. In the event of a novel change in the environment, such as some trees not producing rubber, the agent must be able to change multiple steps in the solution, such as breaking those trees for wood and not using the tree tap on them, to successfully complete the modified task. \n\nAt each step, the agent observes both an image and the environment's symbolic state in JSON text format. \n\nExample images and symbolic information are shown in Fig. 2. Each image is a 256x256 pixel RGB depiction of the agent's current perspective. The JSON text includes positions and names for every object in the environment and every environment-controlled agent, as well as the agent's position and state information (what materials it has collected). This representation is compatible with other possible use cases for agentbased open world novelty detection, where the JSON may represent the environment by listing sensor measurements. \n\nData Collection\n\nNum  Our dataset consists of prerendered observations from an agent pursuing the POGO task, with contents summarized in Tab. 2. The data is organized into episodes, an ordered set of data representing the sequence of steps taken by the agent solving the POGO task. Each episode starts with a different initial environment and ends after the agent has completed the task. Each episode is represented by a folder with both an RGB image and a JSON file detailing the state of the environment after each action the agent took. Each image is labeled, indicating if it depicts a non-standard object. \n\nEach episode has a class label indicating how the POGO environment was modified. We collect images under 3 broad scenarios: the standard environment with no modifications, using creator-designed modifications that impact gameplay, and modifying the environment by inserting new objects that are visible but do not impact gameplay (standard agent can still solve the task). Only one modification is applied per episode, so there is never more than one novelty type in an episode. For all collection, we used an autonomous agent following the DIARC cognitive architecture (Scheutz et al., 2019) to solve the pogo-stick assembly task, as described in Muhammad et al. (2021). This agent does not make use of visual images, relying purely on the symbolic world-state available at each step. \n\nStandard episodes.\n\nUsing the standard environment, we collected a base dataset of 99 standard episodes. \n\nOur agent typically produces 45-56 images per episode (5th-95th percentile). \n\nGameplay-altering modifications. The UT-Dallas PolyCraft team created several modifications that would impact gameplay. We selected two that would be visually recognizable: inserting fences that block access to trees and inserting a tree species with distinct bark that can be harvested more efficiently. Harvesting trees is required to build the pogostick, so both modifications modify agent behavior. We collect 80 fence episodes and 85 tree episodes, with our agent producing 29-72 images per episode (5th-95th percentile range). \n\nInserted object modifications.\n\nFrom a library of possible PolyCraft objects that never appear in the standard task, we selected 51 object types (Tab. A.2) and inserted them into the POGO environment. These objects do not assist or hinder the agent attempting the POGO task, so agent behavior is not changed. We collected at least 10 episodes each, with 32-56 images per episode (5th-95th percentile range). \n\nNovelCraft+: Extra standard episodes. To facilitate models requiring more data we have released NovelCraft+, containing over 2500 episodes and over 100,000 additional frames of standard environment training data. This significantly increases dataset size but results in exaggerated class imbalance between standard and novel images. We use NovelCraft+ to evaluate visual novelty detection (Sec. 4), where class imbalance is best understood and has the least impact. In Sec. 5 and Sec. 6, the original smaller NovelCraft is used for symbolic and multimodal novelty detection and generalized category discovery. \n\nFiltering to identify non-standard images. Within a modified episode, only a few images may actually show non-standard objects. Rendering semantic segmentation maps within the game engine would have been a significant engineering challenge. Therefore we use the locations of agents and objects in the JSON to reconstruct the agent's view within the 3D rendering software Blender (Blender Foundation, 2018). Not all camera parameters were available, so a grid search was used to maximize mean intersection over union for non-standard objects in manually annotated images, achieving 93.0%. For each frame from a modified environment, we can thus render semantic segmentation maps highlighting non-standard objects and record the percentage of pixels containing a non-standard object. We then obtain representative frames from modified episodes by filtering out images with less than 1% non-standard content. This mitigates noise from the rendering, while maintaining challenging examples where non-standard objects are small but clear to a human. Per-frame percentage labels and code for this filtering step are provided in our data release. \n\nSplitting classes into normal/novel and episodes into train/valid/test. We consider 5 total class labels as normal. The \"Standard\" environment with no modifications, the \"Gameplay:Fence\" gameplayaltering modification, and the \"Item:Anvil\", \"Item:Sand\", and \"Item:CoalBlock\" inserted object modifications. This enables methods that repurpose classifiers of multiple normal classes to perform novelty detection. \n\nVisual Novelty Detection\n\nHere, we describe how we use NovelCraft+ to formulate and evaluate the task of visual novelty detection (Sec. 4.1), which methods we consider (Sec. 4.2), and the results of our experiments (Sec. 4.3). Appendix Sec. E provides experiments assessing how training data size impacts results (NovelCraft+ vs. NovelCraft). \n\nTask Description and Evaluation Plan\n\nThe goal of our visual novelty detection task is to develop methods that can distinguish whether an image is novel or not. The predefined training set defines 5 normal classes. The goal on test data is to assess if a given image contains content that is not in one of the normal classes. \n\nPerformance metrics. Detectors are evaluated using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves and precision recall (PR) curves. These visualize tradeoffs across possible thresholds that could be applied to the decision score. The ROC curve assesses tradeoffs between true positive rate (TPR, aka recall) and true negative rate (TNR), while PR compares TPR versus positive predictive value (PPV, aka precision). PR curves provide information about imbalanced tasks like novelty detection that ROC curves alone cannot (Saito & Rehmsmeier, 2015). To summarize performance, we report the area under both curves. Higher numbers mean better detectors. We bold the best score and any others within 1.0 percentage point. \n\nMeasuring the area under ROC and PR curves is insufficient for applications that require automated binary decisions of novel or not. Instead of averaging over many thresholds, one specific threshold must be chosen, ideally in a way that respects the task-specific costs of possible mistakes. We consider two different cost regimes when reporting metrics like TPR, TNR, and PPV. First, we prioritize avoiding false negatives, by selecting a threshold achieving 95% TPR. Liang et al. (2018) also evaluated OOD detectors in this regime. \n\nSecond, we avoid too many false positives among all alerts, via a threshold enforcing 80% precision (PPV). As we later show in Tab. 3, the relative ranking of different detectors can change depending on which regime we select. Picking a method based on area-under-the-curve metrics alone might lead to under-performance in the applied regime of interest. This critical distinction may be under appreciated in current evaluation practice. \n\nFrequency of novelty. The relative frequency of the positive class (novel) matters for metrics such as precision. In a typical novel episode, roughly 25% of frames depict novelty. Yet it is difficult to properly score images where very few pixels (0.01-1%) show the novel object. To handle this, we only score images in the filtered subset of the test set, where we are more confident in the label. Then, for metrics where frequencies matter, we take a weighted average with 75% weight on normal images and 25% on novel images. \n\nMethods for Visual Novelty Detection\n\nWe consider several detection methods representing a variety of approaches. We follow Cheng & Vasconcelos (2021) in finetuning a common pretrained VGG-16 network architecture (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2015) for each method utilizing deep classifiers. Each method can access the predefined validation set to tune hyperparameters. For classifiers, grid search maximizes validation accuracy on the normal classes. Novelty detectors then select to maximize validation AUROC. Details for reproducibility (esp. settings for training and hyperparameter grid search) are in the Appendix. \n\nWe first consider NDCC (Cheng & Vasconcelos, 2021)     et al., 2018) creates an adversarial perturbation (Goodfellow et al., 2015), feeds that through the model, and takes the max of the temperature-scaled softmax output as the score. \n\nNext, we consider a denoising Autoencoder (AE) trained without labels to encode a normal image then reconstruct it accurately. We borrow encoder and decoder architectures from Abati et al. (2019). At test time, the reconstruction error is used as a novelty score, which assumes novel classes will be reconstructed less accurately than the normal classes (Richter & Roy, 2017). Our dataset has large images (256x256), so we consider reconstructions that process 32x32 patches (whole image AEs performed worse). After reconstructing each patch, we aggregate the novelty scores via an average over all patches. \n\nWe finally try a One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM) (Schölkopf et al., 2000). We use the penultimate layer of a finetuned VGG-16 as features and pick an RBF kernel with tuned lengthscale. This model was fit on a subset of 10,000 images due to the method scaling poorly with dataset size. \n\nResults and Analysis of Visual Novelty Detection Experiments\n\nTradeoff curves. Using our new dataset, we evaluated all detection methods described in Sec. 4.2 and report their ROC and PR curve in Fig. 3 When false negatives matter most. In Table 3, when enforcing TPR of 95%, the Autoencoder performs best followed by the One-Class SVM and NDCC. However, there is still clearly room for significant improvement as false positives outnumber both true negatives and true positives. \n\nWhen false positives matter most. In Table 3, when enforcing precision of 80%, we find that NDCC, the Autoencoder and Deep Ensemble perform similarly well with respect to their TNR. TPR values are suprisingly low in the 80% precision regime. This suggests an opportunity for models specialized for low false positive regimes (Rath & Hughes, 2022). \n\nSymbolic and Multimodal Novelty Detection\n\nWhile Sec. 4 focused exclusively on visual processing, we will now compare vision-only models to symbolic models that consume the JSON world-state available at each frame, as well as multimodal models that combine visual and symbolic input. To make this evaluation fair and interesting, here we must focus exclusively on gameplay-altering novelties only, so that the symbolic detection task is non-trivial. In this case, it makes more sense to evaluate novelty detection at the episode-level (aggregating across frames observed over time) rather than at the frame-level. Understanding episode-level performance is valuable for assessing agents acting in the same world over time, as we can highlight key properties such as time-delay until correct detection. \n\nTask Description and Evaluation Plan\n\nFocus on gameplay modification. In our dataset, most modified environments introduce novel objects into the game world that would be trivial to detect symbolically as a never-before-seen key in the JSON description of the world. However, the gameplay novelties by design cause changes in the observable behavior of both agent and environment over time, which a good agent could detect. We thus focus on these gameplay novelties in this task, avoiding trivial easiness by masking any non-standard JSON keys. Because our numerous inserted-object novelties are not appropriate for this task, only a few gameplay novelties remain available. We thus use only the standard episodes from the base NovelCraft dataset for training and validation to maximize diversity in this task's test set, which contains standard episodes and all available gameplay novelty episodes. In addition to the Fence and Tree novelties, we add new Supplier and Thief gameplay novelties, which are exclusive to this task due to only being labeled at the episode level instead of at the frame level. These novelties introduce artificial agents that respectively help and hinder the player, and were released after our initial experiments in Sec. 4 were completed. \n\nEpisode-level predictions. In our proposed benchmark task, models have access to both the RGB image and the JSON symbolic state at each frame in an episode (vision-only methods will ignore the JSON, and symbolic-only methods will ignore the image). The required output is one novelty score for each episode. \n\nFor simplicity, all models predict novelty scores for individual frames, then to score an episode we take the maximum score over all frames. Other strategies for episode-level modeling can be tried in future work. \n\nPerformance metrics. We use the same performance metrics as in Sec. 4.1, evaluated on episodes instead of single frames. While novelty may be easier to detect after experiencing all frames in an episode, failing to detect novelties until the very end of an episode compromises an agent's ability to adapt or take advantage of novelty. We thus also report average detection delay: the number of contiguous frames from the start before a true novelty is detected, averaged across all novelty-containing episodes. \n\nMethods for Multimodal Novelty Detection\n\nSymbolic approach. We reason that jointly modeling the agent's behavior and its environment is useful, as both may be affected by gameplay novelty. We transform the JSON into a multivariate time-series where each frame t is represented by a vector x t of 24 numeric and 2 categorical variables selected from JSON entries for the player and the world. We model the time series via an K-th order autoregressive model, trained to minimize predictive error over the normal-only training set (Choi et al., 2021;Blázquez-García et al., 2021) Table 4: Episodic novelty detection performance (higher is better for all but delay) on gameplay-only test episodes (Sec. 5). Multimodal models perform better than their components with similar delay to visual models. These per-episode results are not directly comparable with per-frame evaluation in Tab. 3. \n\nMultimodal approach. Our multimodal model is a simple ensemble of the visual and symbolic base detectors. For each base detector, we normalize scores to range from 0 and 1 on the validation set. At test time, the multimodal detector reports the sum of the two normalized scores from visual and symbolic. We chose a patch-based autoencoder for the vision component because it has good performance (top 3 ranking or better in every metric of Tab. 3) and does not require more than one training class (unlike NDCC or ODIN). \n\nResults and Analysis: Symbolic and Multimodal Novelty Detection\n\nTab. 4 reports the performance of visual, symbolic, and multimodal detectors. Overall, this episode-level evaluation intuitively produces higher TPR, TNR, and PPV scores than previous frame-level analysis, due to less sensitivity to frame-level noise. Looking at symbolic performance, 5-frame contexts yield significantly better performance than 2-frame contexts on ROC based metrics, suggesting medium-range temporal modeling matters for our benchmark. Finally, the multimodal ensemble nicely blends the best of both visual and symbolic models to improve performance with delay similar to the visual model across both cost regimes. Future methods have plenty of room to improve (human performance would be close to 100% AUROC). \n\n6 Generalized Category Discovery \n\nTask Description and Evaluation Plan\n\nBoth generalized category discovery (GCD) (Vaze et al., 2022) and novel category discovery (NCD) (Zhao & Han, 2021;Han et al., 2020) consider the problem of assigning labels to a set of unlabeled data by utilizing a set of related labeled data. NCD assumes this unlabeled data contains only new classes not seen in the labeled data, while GCD allows labeled classes and new classes to appear in the unlabeled set. Unlike novelty detection, both the labeled and unlabeled data are available during training. During testing, clustering accuracy is used to evaluate the labels assigned to the unlabeled set. We additionally report clustering accuracy on the subset of classes seen in the labeled set as well as the new classes. \n\nTo try GCD on our base NovelCraft data, we utilize our training split as the labeled set and our validation split as the unlabeled set. This results in 5 classes in the labeled set and 10 classes in the unlabeled set, which includes new examples of the labeled set classes. In our evaluation we assume prior knowledge of the number of new classes in the unlabeled set, but future evaluations may utilize the method in Vaze et al. (2022) to select the number of new classes. We leave GCD assessment on our larger NovelCraft+ to future work, as methods for GCD under severe class imbalance have not been well explored to our knowledge. \n\nMethods for Category Discovery\n\nGCD SSKM. Following Vaze et al. (2022), we use a ViT-B-16 (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) vision transformer pretrained with DINO (Caron et al., 2021) self-supervision on unlabeled ImageNet then fine-tuned with the GCD contrastive loss on NovelCraft. The contrastive loss proposed by Vaze et al. (2022) has an unlabeled term and a labeled term, with the unlabeled term applied to all data and the labeled term applied only to labeled data. The unlabeled term encourages two random augmentations of the same image to be mapped close to each other in embedding space, penalizing being close to different images in the same mini-batch. The labeled term encourages each pair of images that share a class to be mapped close to each other in embedding space, penalizing being close to images from other classes. \n\nClass-balanced sampling is utilized on the labeled set to account for class imbalance. The learned features from this model are then fed into semi-supervised k-means (SSKM) (Vaze et al., 2022), which learns cluster assignments for all examples that respect known labels from the labeled set. \n\nDINO SSKM baseline.\n\nTo examine the effectiveness of GCD's fine-tuning, we compare to a semi-supervised k-means baseline that uses pretrained DINO features. We chose this instead of unsupervised k-means as in Vaze et al. (2022), so that both methods utilize the labeled set examples. \n\nSemi-supervised Gaussian mixture. To examine the effectiveness of SSKM's clustering, we compare to a semi-supervised Gaussian mixture model (SSGMM). SSGMM is a new extension of Gaussian mixture models that applies the semi-supervision method of SSKM (Vaze et al., 2022) to learn cluster assignments that respect known labels from the labeled set. SSGMM should be more flexible as it allows soft assignment (multiple clusters can take partial responsibility for a given data example), can learn the frequencies of each cluster, and can learn the appropriate scaling of a cluster-specific spherical covariance. In contrast, k-means assumes hard assignment (each data example matched to exactly one cluster), assumes uniform cluster frequencies, and represents the limiting behavior when all clusters share a single spherical covariance whose scale diminishes to zero. We use a modified version of expectation maximization (Dempster et al., 1977) to fit this GMM in semi-supervised fashion. Semi-supervision is introduced by modifying the expectation step so that each labeled example is assigned to the correct cluster corresponding to its label as in SSKM, with no responsibility assigned to incorrect clusters. \n\nResults and Analysis\n\nClustering   Improving GCD to address class imbalance in unlabeled data will be challenging. Balancing the labeled examples used by semi-supervised k-means risks increasing the splitting of more frequent classes, such as the predicted I3 and I4 classes consisting of a subset of the most frequent classes. Separating new classes from the standard class likely requires specialized modifications to the loss, as all unlabeled data resemble standard class images to some extent. \n\nDiscussion and Outlook\n\nWe hope our NovelCraft dataset inspires new methods development on novelty detection and characterization, enabling agents to explore open worlds. \n\nLimitations.\n\nOur benchmark focuses on one specific open world. We wish to avoid overclaiming about generality (Raji et al., 2021). Many other open worlds are possible. The kinds of visual properties we call novel emphasize object types. We could instead have varied counts, sizes, spatial relationships, or co-occurrance patterns between objects. We include only a few gameplay modifications due to the cost of creating these. More diverse gameplay novelties that are not trivial to detect symbolically would be worth future investment. \n\nOur multimodal experiments are limited to our specific choice for JSON data. JSON can encode less precise sensory inputs which are worth further exploration. \n\nFuture Directions. We can foresee several promising lines of work building on our NovelCraft data: \n\nMultimodal novelty detection. A recent review suggests that multimodal novelty detection is \"a largely unexplored research area\" (Pang et al., 2022). Our dataset provides two complementary modalities, symbolic and visual, that could both be leveraged by future methods. \n\nContinual learning. Our new dataset is naturally episodic in nature. Future work could use a continual learning paradigm (Lin et al., 2021) instead of \"train once, then deploy\", which is far more realistic for open-world learning. Our discovery task in Sec. 6 could be a promising first step. \n\nFrom vision to action. Our dataset is collected by a real artificial agent interacting in a virtual world. Future work could use visual novelty processing to inform how the agent selects actions to solve its task. Active perception is especially promising: novel objects may or may not look novel from all perspectives; an agent may need to actively obtain distinct perspectives to determine a new object's properties and how it could be used in service of the agent's goal. \n\nBroader Impact Statement\n\nWe have designed our dataset with the goal of positive benefit to society. We think novelty detection and characterization can help build agents that recognize when a model is not suitable (and might even be harmful) and adapt accordingly. We hope that our findings on the difficulties of adapting models from research settings to applications encourages users to always inspect a model's potential impacts. We recognize that there is a potential for misuse, as with all classifiers and especially visual ones, if the classifier is used to discriminate by gender, ethnicity, and other protected categories. Ultimately, we hope that the potential of novelty detection to preempt accidental misuse will outweigh the impacts of purposeful misuse of these techniques. \n\nSplits is provided with the dataset code as \"splits.csv\" and lists the splits for the training set classes, divided by episode. Which classes are assigned to novel validation and novel test are listed in \"data_const.py\". \n\nC Training and Model Details\n\nC.1 Visual Novelty Detection\n\nExcept for NDCC and One-Class SVM, all methods are implemented in PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2019) and are trained and tested on a GPU (NVIDIA TITAN X Pascal). NDCC was trained and tested on a NVIDIA RTX 2080 GPU, but note that fewer training epochs is the primary reason for reduced training time. The One-Class SVM is implemented using the SciKit-Learn software package (Pedregosa et al., 2011) and is trained and tested on a CPU. See \n\nC.1.1 VGG-16 Backbone\n\nA VGG-16 (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2015) is used as a backbone for deep ensemble and ODIN and as a feature extractor for the one-class SVM. \n\nArchitecture. The VGG-16 model of the PyTorch framework (Paszke et al., 2019) pretrained on ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009) is adapted and fine tuned to classify the normal classes. The pretrained classification head is replaced with a randomly initialized 5 output fully connected layer classication head. \n\nTraining Details.We optimize the parameters using the cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer (Kingma & Ba, 2014) Training Details. We train the predictive models using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 10 −4 for 50 epochs with early stopping. We use default parameters of 0 weight decay and β 1,2 = (0.9, 0.999) in the optimizer. For numerical features, the loss function optimized is MSE whereas for categorical features we optimize Categorical Cross-Entropy. \n\nHyperparameter Tuning. For our predictive MLP models we fine-tune the number of hidden layers, and a single value for all hidden dimensions. We perform grid search over 1 to 3 hidden layers with step size 1 with hidden dimensions varying between 16 to 64 with step size 16. We perform model selection based on the validation predictive loss. For all three settings of the context size, the final hyperparameters are 2 hidden layers with hidden dimension of 64. We also use a default dropout rate of 0.2 for all models and ReLU activations in all layers except the last. \n\nAnomaly Scores. To calculate anomaly scores for a single time-step we take the maximum over the predictive loss of all variables in the vector. \n\nC.3 Generalized Category Discovery\n\nArchitecture. Following Vaze et al. (2022), we use a ViT-B-16 (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) vision transformer pretrained with DINO (Caron et al., 2021) self-supervision on unlabeled ImageNet then fine-tuned on NovelCraft. \n\nTraining Details. Fine-tuning is done with the GCD contrastive loss with supervised loss weight 0.35. Training consists of 200 epochs of SGD optimization with a cosine annealed learning rate ending at the initial learning rate times 0.01. \n\nHyperparameter Tuning. Supervised loss weights of 0 and 1 were tested to verify that the combination of losses was increasing performance. Initial learning rates 1, 0.1, 0.01, and 0.001 were tested with 0.1 found to best minimize training loss, reaching −1.21 mean loss. \n\nD Further Comparisons to Related Work\n\nD.1 Further Discussion and Analysis of Related Datasets. \n\nSurveillance-focused datasets. Work on anomaly detection in complex scenes has often been motivated by surveillance applications (Ramachandra et al., 2022), such as the UCSD Anomaly Detection dataset (Li et al., 2014). The yearly PETS challenges (Patino et al., 2017) have offered open datasets with anomalies such as abandoned baggage. Unlike these fixed camera datasets, our dataset uses a dynamic, egocentric camera and enjoys fewer ethical concerns than surveillance. \n\nComparison to scene-focused datasets. In Tab. D.1 (next page), we provide a comprehensive comparison of available datasets focused on scene-focused visual tasks that seem especially relevant for novelty/anomaly detection. We thank anonymous reviewers for bringing some of these to our attention. \n\nTo recap the major takeaway messages from this \n\nD.2 Performance Comparion Across Datasets for Visual Novelty Detection\n\nSee Table D.2 for visual novelty detection results on other datasets. Our benchmark is more challenging than many existing visual novelty detection evaluations, with only the experiments by Cheng & Vasconcelos (2021) on CUB-200-2010and Abati et al. (2019) on CIFAR10 getting similar AUROC metrics. We also note that varying model backbones, evaluation methodologies, datasets, and the use of only AUROC as a metric hinders model comparison. We hope to enable future comparisons between models by providing a dataset with defined visual novelty evaluation methodology, evaluations of a variety of methods with the same backbone, and more metrics for detailed model comparisons. \n\nMethod\n\nBackbone \n\n\n\n      \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n

As internet adoption grows in these regions, an increasing share of web content is created in languages other than English. Many of these languages use non-Latin writing systems such as Devanagari, Bengali, Arabic, or Thai and are often presented alongside English in mixed-language interfaces [28][29][30]. Popular screen readers like JAWS [2] and NVDA [7] still exhibit limited support for non-Latin scripts and often perform poorly when confronted with mixed languages [14,25,40,41]. These tools may misrender non-English words or produce unintelligible output, as has been documented with languages like Nepali [38]. \n\nThe root of the problem lies in the inadequate usage of text alternatives [12,24] metadata such as lang attributes or image alt text, which screen readers use to process content appropriately. When such metadata is absent, incorrect, or inconsistent with the visible text, it creates a mismatch between the displayed content and what the assistive tool offers. This issue is compounded for scripts that require complex shaping or language-specific pronunciation models. For example, Apple's VoiceOver [11], the default screen reader on macOS and iOS devices, does not provide any support for languages such as Urdu, Amharic, or Burmese [11]. This lack of linguistic inclusivity is at odds with the principles laid out by the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative, which advocates for equal digital access regardless of language or ability [43]. \n\nWeb accessibility research only marginally studies the intersection of multilingualism and assistive technology [17,18]. A key bottleneck in this area is the lack of data. Widely used datasets like Tranco [31] focus on popularity but do not provide any insight into the linguistic composition of websites. This limits the researchers' ability to measure the prevalence of multilingual content and to assess the accessibility landscape for speakers of less commonly supported languages. To bridge this gap, we introduce LangCrUX, a largescale dataset of 120,000 popular websites across 12 languages that primarily use non-Latin scripts. We construct LangCrUX by selecting high-traffic websites from the Chrome User Experience Report (CrUX) dataset, verifying language use via automated script detection and manual sampling, and through Puppeteer-based crawls routed via country-specific VPNs to capture localized versions of each site. \n\nWe leverage LangCrUX to conduct the first large-scale analysis of multilingual web accessibility, focusing on how assistive technologies interact with real-world, multilingual web content. Our findings reveal that nearly 40% of websites in Bangladesh and India lack any accessibility text in the native language, despite having predominantly native-language visible content. More broadly, language-aware accessibility remains a widespread and under-addressed issue: many websites use non-descriptive, placeholder, or untranslated text (e.g., \"file1, \" \"button, \" or generic English terms) in critical accessibility elements like image alt text. These mismatches significantly reduce the utility of screen readers, which rely on metadata to convey meaningful information to users. We observe that current automated accessibility testing tools fail to detect these language inconsistencies, as they typically only evaluate the presence of accessibility hints. To address this gap, we propose and develop Kizuki 1 , a testing extension that identifies such mismatches and evaluates metadata based on alignment with the surrounding linguistic context, offering a more inclusive measure of accessibility. \n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nOur study investigates the accessibility of websites in non-Latin-script languages, focusing on linguistic diversity in underrepresented language communities. We collect LangCrUX, a dataset comprising websites with a high proportion of non-Latin-script content, combining data from the Chrome User Experience Report (CrUX) [8], custom web crawls using Puppeteer, and language metadata verification. Figure 1 visualizes our methodology, including dataset construction, language selection, and automated accessibility analysis. \n\nLangCrUX is released as an open-source dataset on GitHub. 2 \n\nLanguage and Country Selection Criteria: We begin with a pool of 26 widely spoken non-Latin-script languages, including Hindi, Bangla, Modern Standard Arabic, Tamil, Telugu, Mandarin Chinese, Urdu, Amharic, Russian, Marathi, and others [6]. Our goal is to identify a diverse, representative set of languages underrepresented in web accessibility research, particularly those using non-Latin writing systems. Language selection is guided by three main factors: script type (non-Latin), size of the global speaker base, and geographic and linguistic diversity. To ensure representativeness 1 named after the Japanese word for \"awareness\" 2 https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LangCrux-F68F Figure 2: Native language distribution in visible text for India and Israel in LangCrUX and sufficient data, we apply two strict inclusion criteria: 1) at least 10,000 websites with 50% or more visible textual content in the target language, and 2) inclusion in the CrUX datasetwhich provides user experience metrics from Chrome userswith sufficient traffic and performance data. Applying these filters results in a final set of 12 language-country pairs, each uniquely representing a distinct non-Latin-script language with a verifiable web presence. Because the initial pool alone did not yield enough languages that met these thresholds, we expanded the selection to include additional ones such as Hebrew, Sinhala, Greek, and Burmese. These were added to increase script and regional diversity while still satisfying our inclusion criteria. \n\nThe selected countries, their corresponding languages, and approximate global speaker populations are China (Mandarin Chinese, 1.2 billion), India (Hindi, 609 million), Algeria (Modern Standard Arabic, 335 million), Bangladesh (Bangla, 284 million), Russia (Russian, 253 million), Japan (Japanese, 126 million), Egypt (Egyptian Arabic, 119 million), Hong Kong (Cantonese, 85.5 million), South Korea (Korean, 82 million), Thailand (Thai, 71 million), Greece (Greek, 13.5 million), and Israel (Hebrew, 9 million). Collectively, these 12 languages are spoken by over 3.19 billion people, representing about 39.5% of the global population. For languages spoken in multiple countries, such as Modern Standard Arabic, used in Algeria, Saudi Arabia, and Morocco, we select the country with the highest population of native speakers, in this case, Algeria. In multilingual countries like India, we include all major non-Latin-script languages with substantial speaker populations. However, only Hindi meets our data threshold; other widely spoken languages, such as Tamil and Telugu, do not meet the 10,000-website requirement and are excluded. Similar exclusions apply to Sinhala (Sri Lanka) and Georgian (Georgia), where websites with sufficient native-language content fell below the threshold despite initial inclusion. \n\nWebsite Selection: We use Google CrUX to identify and rank websites by real-world usage metrics. For each selected language-country pair, we extract the top 10,000 websites based on CrUX rankings, which reflect user engagement, load performance, and interaction quality. To validate language presence, we use a Unicode-based heuristic that matches visible text content against script-specific character ranges (e.g., Devanagari for Hindi, Hangul for Korean, and Cyrillic for Russian). For overlapping scripts, such as Arabic and Urdu, we include additional language-specific characters to improve precision. A website is retained if at least 50% of its visible textual content is in the target language. Websites that do not meet this threshold are excluded and replaced with the next-ranking candidate from the CrUX list. In cases where 10,000 qualifying websites could not be found among the top-ranked entries, we extended our search to lowerranked websites within the CrUX database to fulfill the quota. Figure 2 illustrates the distribution of visible content by language for two representative cases: Hindi websites in India and Hebrew websites in Israel. \n\nData Collection: To extract accessibility-related features from the selected websites, we develop a web crawler using Puppeteer [9], which simulates web browsing conditions in a Chromium environment. Each website is visited programmatically, allowing us to capture network-level metadata, page structure, and accessibility indicators such as alternative text, ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes (which enhance the semantics of web elements for assistive technologies [1]), and declared language tags. \n\nTo capture the localized experience of users in each country, we route all browser traffic through VPN servers physically hosted in the corresponding country. This step is critical for collecting region-specific versions of websites, as many sites dynamically serve content-including language settings, layout, or accessibility features-based on the user's IP location. Without VPN-based localization, web crawlers risk accessing global or English-dominant versions of websites that do not accurately reflect the intended user experience of native speakers. We use a combination of commercial VPN services, including ProtonVPN [10] and Hotspot Shield [23], to achieve broad geographic coverage. Since not all VPN providers have servers in every target country, we select the provider on a per-country basis to ensure reliable and consistent access from within national borders. Compared to crawling from generic cloud-hosted IPs, this approach offers a significantly more realistic vantage point, reducing the risk of content variation, redirection, or censorship artifacts that may otherwise skew accessibility analysis. \n\nAccessibility Element Selection Criteria:\n\nTo identify accessibility elements where natural language plays a critical role, we follow a structured process based on the Lighthouse accessibility auditing framework [20]. Lighthouse evaluates a range of accessibility checks, each associated with specific HTML elements and best practices. Our goal is to select those elements for which the presence, clarity, and appropriateness of natural language directly influence accessibility outcomes. \n\nbutton-name document-title image-alt frame-title summary-name label input-image-alt select-name link-name input-button-name svg-img-alt object-alt\n\nTable 1: Web elements requiring natural language. \n\nWe begin by examining the set of Lighthouse accessibility tests, which internally relies on the Axe-core accessibility engine [5]. For each test, we identify the corresponding HTML element it targets (e.g., <img>, <button>, <input>). We then analyze the test rationale by referencing the associated rule definitions from Axe-core, which provide detailed explanations and criteria for each audit. From these specifications, we assess whether natural language content is integral to the test. Specifically, we ask whether the accessibility of the element depends on human-readable text, for example, whether a screen reader user would rely on the clarity and relevance of that text to understand the element's purpose. \n\nIf natural language is central to the function or evaluation of the element, we include it in our set. Following this process, we identify the twelve elements listed in Table 1 as language-sensitive accessibility features. \n\nThese elements span a range of interface components, including images, forms, buttons, and navigation elements, all of which rely on meaningful textual descriptions to be accessible to users with visual impairments. We explicitly exclude certain tests, such as video-caption. Although captions are inherently language-dependent and critical for accessibility, accurately evaluating them at scale poses challenges. In many cases, captions are not embedded in the HTML but are provided through separate files (e.g., VTT or SRT) or dynamically loaded via JavaScript. These may be inaccessible to crawlers unless the video is played or fully rendered in the browser. Furthermore, identifying whether a video has accurate, synchronized, and complete captions often requires manual inspection or audio-visual comparison-steps outside the scope of automated large-scale analysis. Due to these limitations, we omit video-caption checks to maintain consistency and reproducibility in our methodology. \n\nLimitations: Our methodology has several limitations. First, reliance on CrUX limits our scope to websites with measurable Chrome traffic, potentially excluding low-traffic or highly localized websites. Next, while using a VPN allows accessing region-specific versions of websites, some websites may detect VPN use and return generic or restricted versions. In such cases, we replace the affected websites with the next eligible candidate. Additionally, Puppeteer's simulated browsing environment may not fully reflect user experiences. Finally, language detection (both automated and manual) can be challenged by embedded content or non-standard scripts, though our 50% content threshold and manual verification aim to reduce this risk. \n\nIS MULTILINGUAL WEB ACCESSIBLE?\n\nTable 2 provides statistics on the quality and presence of accessibility text across twelve HTML elements. For each element, we report the median, standard deviation, and average percentage of websites where the accessibility attribute is missing or empty. We also include metrics like text length (in characters) and word count to assess richness and verbosity. These measurements allow us to compare how frequently accessibility features are implemented and how informative they are when present. In the following, we analyze these patterns by examining missing and empty values, evaluating text length and word count, filtering uninformative content, and characterizing the language distribution of informative accessibility text. \n\nPrevalence of Missing and Empty Accessibility Texts:\n\nMissing accessibility text is a widespread issue across HTML elements. Several elements exhibit extremely high average missing rates, including label (98.5%), svg-img-alt (96.6%), link-name (95.9%), input-button-name (93.9%), and summary-name (90.47%). The image-alt attribute stands out for its relatively lower average missing rate (17.12%) but exhibits the highest percentage of empty values (25.39%). Although our findings show that it is possible to pass the Lighthouse audit for image accessibility by setting the alt attribute to an empty string, such text does not convey meaningful information to users (Appendix D). Compared to non-multilingual websites, the missing percentage is slightly higher (15.19% vs. 17.12%) and the empty percentage is notably higher (16.36% vs. 25.39%), indicating a greater tendency to include but not meaningfully populate the attribute in multilingual contexts. \n\nAttributes like button-name and link-name, which are essential for identifying interactive components, also show high missing rates (61.92% and 95.96%, respectively). Similarly, attributes associated with form controls, such as input -button-name and select-name, are frequently absent or left empty, compromising the clarity of form interactions. A likely reason for these high rates is that, in many cases, screen readers fall back to reading visible HTML text (such as the inner text of a button or link) when accessibility attributes like aria-label, label, or alt are missing. This fallback behavior reduces the perceived need for developers to explicitly include accessibility metadata, especially when the element already includes visible text. \n\nText Length and Word Count Analysis: Table 2 also captures the descriptive quality of accessibility text through text length and word count metrics. Among the elements, link-name has a relatively high average text length (∼27 characters) and word count (∼5), compared to summary-name, select-name, label, and button-name, which show lower average word counts (1.17, 2.31, 1.67, and 3.86, respectively). This suggests that link descriptions tend to be more detailed and contextually informative. However, for some other elements, shorter texts are often acceptable; for example, buttons labeled \"Login,\" \"Send,\" or \"Submit\" typically provide sufficient clarity with just one or two words. \n\nFor elements like image-alt, which require contextual descriptions to convey the meaning of an image, we find an average word count of only ∼4. This shortness, especially when combined with the high empty rate noted earlier, suggests a broader trend of developers including minimal or superficial alt text, possibly to satisfy automated checks rather than to genuinely enhance accessibility. Finally, the table reveals substantial outliers, e.g., image-alt has a maximum of 261,864 characters and 12,306 words, while link-name 5,228 characters and 518 words. These extreme but rare cases likely indicate instances where extraneous content, such as metadata, boilerplate text, or full paragraphs, has been mistakenly inserted into accessibility attributes, potentially overwhelming assistive technologies and undermining user experience (see Appendix E for examples). \n\nFiltering Uninformative Accessibility Text:\n\nTo assess the quality of accessibility text, we apply a filtering step to discard uninformative or placeholder texts. This is essential because the presence of an alt or aria-label attribute does not guarantee usefulness. Labels such as button, file1, or image1 may satisfy automated checks but provide no semantic value to screen reader users. We define a set of heuristics to classify accessibility texts into eleven categories, distinguishing between useful and discardable content. These include short strings, file paths, placeholders, developer labels, etc. Appendix H shows the full list of filtering rules. Appendix G shows the breakdown by HTML element. \n\nFigure 3 shows the percentage distribution of filtered accessibility texts across countries and categories. One of the most common issues is the use of generic single words. For example, in Thailand, over 33% of accessibility texts are singleword labels. High rates are also observed in Russia (22.2%), Greece (18.03%), and India (17.1%). In contrast, countries like Bangladesh (6.9%) and Egypt (10.5%) show lower proportions. A small but non-negligible portion of texts are too short to convey meaning. In Russia, 4.26% of labels fall into this category, followed by Thailand (4.24%), Israel (4.03%), and India (3.6%). Some websites also use raw URLs or file  paths as labels. This affects 3.8% of labels in Hong Kong, 3.5% in South Korea, and 3.17% in Russia. These findings show that even when accessibility text is present, it often lacks descriptive content. This reinforces the need to go beyond presence-based metrics and assess the actual semantic value of accessibility labels. \n\nLanguage Distribution of Informative Accessibility Text:\n\nAfter removing uninformative and placeholder accessibility text, we reanalyze the remaining content to understand the language distribution of texts that are potentially useful. This filtered set reflects more intentional and meaningful uses of alt, label, and other accessibility attributes. Figure 4 shows the proportion of accessibility texts written in native languages, English, or a mix of both, across the 12 analyzed countries. A prominent pattern is the heavy reliance on English, even in countries where it is not the primary language. In Bangladesh, 79% of informative accessibility texts are in English, the highest among all countries analyzed. Egypt, Thailand, and Greece also show a strong tendency to default to English. This suggests that developers may rely on English for accessibility metadata due to limited localization tools or being unaware of screen reader needs in native languages. Another important pattern is the use of mixed-language accessibility hints, where a single alt attribute contains both the native language and English. This occurs frequently in Greece (35%), Thailand (34%), and Hong Kong (30%), and in over 20% of websites in China, Russia, Japan, and India. While sometimes intended to aid multilingual users, such mixing often confuses screen readers, which typically do not handle language switching within a single label, resulting in mispronunciations or reduced clarity. \n\nLANGUAGE-AWARE ACCESSIBILITY\n\nMismatch Between Visible and Accessibility Text: Figure 5 compares native language usage in visible versus accessibility text across the 12 analyzed countries. While the visible content of many websites is multilingual or predominantly in the native language, the associated accessibility metadata, such as alt text, aria-labels, and form labels, is typically written in English. This mismatch is especially noticeable in countries like India and Bangladesh, where over 40% of websites have less than 10% of their accessibility text in the native language. Thailand, China, and Hong Kong also show similar trends, with more than a quarter of their websites falling into this category. In contrast, countries like Japan and Israel have significantly lower rates of mismatch, with fewer than 10% of websites showing such disparities. For blind users who rely on screen readers, this language discrepancy introduces an additional barrier, forcing them to navigate a bilingual interface where visible content and assistive text do not align. Appendix F provides a detailed view of the mismatch by visualizing the distribution of visible versus accessibility text across all countries in our dataset. \n\nFor example, in Bangladesh, https://teachers.gov.bd is a widely used government education portal. Although more than 98% of its visible content is in Bangla, only one of the 79 images with alt attributes uses Bangla. Comparable patterns are also seen in India, Thailand, and China. The Indian website https://cmhelpline.mp.gov.in has a Hindi version where the interface is almost entirely in Hindi, but all accessibility text is in English. The Thai news website https://www. khaosod.co.th contains over 92% of its visible content in Thai, but its accessibility labels are mostly in English. The Chinese provincial government site https://kjt.shaanxi.gov.cn is almost fully in Chinese, yet its accessibility texts are entirely in English. Mismatch examples are provided in Appendix I. \n\nAdding Language Awareness to Lighthouse: Automated testing tools such as Lighthouse do not consider the language of accessibility text when evaluating compliance. As a result, alt attributes are marked as present regardless of whether their content matches the language of the surrounding interface. To address this limitation, we introduce Kizuki, a Lighthouse extension that incorporates language awareness in accessibility evaluation. Specifically, we extend the audit for image alt text to verify whether the description is written in the same language as the page's visible content. \n\nWe evaluate Kizuki on 10,000 websites from Bangladesh and Thailand, two countries where language mismatch between visible content and accessibility metadata is particularly common. For fairness, we exclude websites that fail the original Lighthouse test due to missing alt attributes. Figure 6 shows the resulting shift in accessibility scores. Without considering language, 43% of websites received a Lighthouse score above 90 (considered \"good\" [3,4]), and 5.6% achieved a perfect score. After applying Kizuki's language-aware check, these numbers dropped significantly: only 15.8% of websites scored above 90, and just 1.8% retained a perfect score. \n\nRELATED WORK\n\nSeveral studies have explored the challenges of multilingual web accessibility. Vázquez et al. [33,34,36,42] conducted user studies highlighting the limitations of screen readers in handling multilingual interfaces. Casalegno [15]  reported similar findings, emphasizing the cognitive strain users face when navigating mixed-language content. García-Garcinuño et al. [17] confirmed that language mismatches in screen reader output persist even when markup is correctly annotated. Vázquez et al. [35,37] also showed that accessibility is often excluded from localization workflows, leading to untranslated alt text and inconsistent metadata. Several works highlight problems such as mispronunciation, broken accents, or robotic voices in the context of multilingual content for screen readers [25,40,41]. Sankhi et al. [38] documented similar barriers in Nepal, while Raghavendra et al. [32] pointed to the lack of robust multilingual speech synthesis systems in Indian languages, emphasizing infrastructural challenges for regional screen reader development. \n\nResearchers also explored automated solutions to tackle accessibility issues. Several approaches are proposed for alt text generation, including human-curated [19,46], image-searchbased [21,27], and AI-based methods [13,16,45]. While human and search-based approaches emphasize contextual accuracy and reusability, AI-driven techniques offer scalable alternatives, including generating captions [22,26,39] or even producing the image itself with embedded descriptions [13]. However, these methods still rely on high-quality training data and often require human oversight to ensure contextual relevance and inclusivity. \n\nCONCLUSION\n\nMultilingual web content is increasing in prevalence, but accessibility support lags behind, especially for non-Latin scripts. This paper introduces LangCrUX, the first large-scale dataset of 120,000 popular websites across 12 languages that primarily use non-Latin scripts. Analysis of the LangCrUX dataset reveals widespread issues and motivates languageaware accessibility improvements such as Kizuki, a Google Lighthouse extension we developed, which incorporates language consistency checks into accessibility testing. We hope that our dataset, which we will open source, will spark the community's interest to further measure the implications of an increasingly multilingual web. \n\nA ETHICS\n\nThis work does not raise any ethical issues. \n\nB DATA AND TOOL AVAILABILITY\n\nWe have open-sourced both the LangCrUX dataset and Kizuki. Kizuki includes detailed documentation and a README file explaining how to use it and how to extend it with custom accessibility tests. We have also created an interactive website for LangCrUX, where users can explore the dataset in greater detail, including language distribution across individual websites, with sampling and filtering options. \n\nThe dataset and testing tool are available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LangCrux-F68F/ The interactive website is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/w/LangCrux-F68F/ \n\nC DISTRIBUTION OF WEBSITE RANKINGS\n\nD EVALUATION OF ACCESSIBILITY ELEMENTS USING LIGHTHOUSE\n\nE EXAMPLES OF EXTREME ACCESSIBILITY TEXT VALUES\n\nTable 4 shows examples of image alt texts that exceed 1000 characters. These values were extracted from real-world webpages from Bangladesh, India, Japan, Greece, and Thailand, and are shown along with the corresponding source URLs. The examples illustrate cases where accessibility attributes contain unusually long descriptive content, often including entire paragraphs or embedded metadata. \n\nF COUNTRY-LEVEL SCATTER PLOTS\n\nTo complement the main analysis, we include country-specific scatter plots, shown in Figure 8, displaying the distribution of websites based on the percentage of native-language content in visible versus accessibility text. Each point represents one site, with the x-axis representing the share of visible content in the native language, and the y-axis representing the share of accessibility metadata in the same language. These plots offer a more detailed view of the language mismatch patterns discussed in Section §3. As an illustration, consider the scatter plot for Thai websites, shown in Figure 8k. Points near the bottom of the plot represent websites where there is almost no accessibility metadata in Thai, regardless of the language used in the visible content. A dense cluster in the bottom right corner indicates websites where the visible content is almost entirely in Thai, but the accessibility text includes little or no Thai. In contrast, points in the top right corner represent websites where both the visible and accessibility content are predominantly in Thai, indicating consistent language use across both types of content. \n\nG ELEMENT-LEVEL FILTERING ANALYSIS\n\nFigure 9 shows the distribution of uninformative accessibility text by HTML element. Generic action labels are especially common in <button> (14.2%) and <input> buttons (13.5%), indicating vague, non-descriptive usage. Single-word labels are the most prevalent issue overall, notably in <label> (24.4%), <image-alt> (17.1%), and <select> (15.3%) elements. These short, generic strings often fail to provide meaningful context. <summary> elements show both high generic action (42.9%) and single-word rates (40.5%), highlighting minimal semantic value. These trends suggest a need for deeper evaluation of accessibility text beyond its presence. \n\nH FILTERING UNINFORMATIVE ACCESSIBILITY TEXT\n\nTo assess the informativeness of accessibility text (e.g., alt, aria-label, or label attributes), we apply a rule-based filtering pipeline to discard generic or low-quality entries. Below, we outline each discard category, its rationale, and representative examples. \n\nI EXAMPLES OF MISMATCH BETWEEN VISIBLE AND ACCESSIBILITY TEXT\n\nTable 5 illustrates examples of accessibility mismatches on six websites across Bangladesh, India, Thailand, Egypt, China, and Hong Kong. Each cell consists of an image from the website, the corresponding URL, and the alt text or accessibility description associated with that image. The examples highlight cases where website content is presented in the native language, yet the accessibility descriptions, such as alt texts, are written in English. This language inconsistency creates confusion for screen reader users and demonstrates the need for language-aligned accessibility practices. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n     \n\n\n\n      \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n

However, the clinical application of the 3-point pressure principle has some limitations. The rigid curves, high thoracic curves, or large Cobb angles in some patients with AIS often reduce the effectiveness of the 3-point pressure system. 10,11 These limitations may be compensated by concurrently applying the traction in a sagittal plane along with the corrective pressures in the transverse plane to the spine. 12 The effect of combining the transverse 3-point force system with the longitudinal traction on patients with scoliosis has also remained unclear and merits further investigation. \n\n4][15][16] The brace treatment combines the coronal 3-point pressures/ forces and the transverse vertebral derotation force. 15 It can release the rigid soft tissue, reduce the scoliosis angle, improve surgical outcomes, and reduce the complications of surgical treatment. 13 However, the bracing treatment outcome can vary due to different factors, such as curve location, coronal deformity angular ratio value, and soft tissue characteristics. 14,17,18 For instance, when the number of constituent curvature vertebrae was less, the coronal deformity angular ratio value would increase, which may lead to a decrease in the corrective effectiveness. 19 1][22] The third scenario was that when the apex vertebra was located at T12, L1, L4, or L5, the transmission of the corrective force would be hindered by the ribs and iliac crests, which would adversely affect the effectiveness of the correction. 16,22,23 he fourth scenario was that in obese adolescents with scoliosis, the excessive soft tissue may also reduce the effectiveness of the 3D correction provided by the coronal 3-point pressure and transverse vertebral derotation force. 24 Furthermore, there were also some cases where the lateral forces could not work optimally for in-brace correction. It would be interesting to study if a device that is capable of simultaneously applying the 3D longitudinal traction forces and transverse corrective forces could provide better treatment outcomes for patients with these types of scoliosis. \n\nSpinal flexibility is an important indicator in AIS treatment and a reference of how much of the correction can be applied to an AIS patient's spine during both surgical 25 and conservative 26,27 treatments. Some recent studies have supported that spinal flexibility can predict the curve progression in patients with AIS. Specifically, patients with AIS with higher flexibility tend to experience less curve progression and better treatment outcomes. 28  has been primarily improved through physiotherapy scoliosis-specific exercise 29 or some spinal stretching exercises 30 in patients with AIS. However, the potential for motorized or automated systems to enhance spinal flexibility and alleviate scoliotic curvature has remained unclear and requires further exploration. To address the above-mentioned issues, this study proposed, developed, and applied a novel scoliosis correction system that generated both spinal longitudinal traction (based on the standard mechanical spinal traction protocol for managing low back pain) and transverse forces (based on the 3-point pressure system). We aimed to verify its efficacy in treating patients with AIS, especially in improving spinal flexibility. It is hypothesized that the developed mechanical 3D scoliosis correction system and protocol could improve spinal flexibility immediately after 1 training session in patients with AIS with moderate scoliosis curves. Upon examining and verifying the feasibility, effects, and optimization with more future clinical trials, this novel treatment machine and protocol could provide a new approach for conservative treatments and further improve the treatment outcomes in patients with AIS. \n\nMethods\n\n3D scoliosis correction system for delivering mechanical 3D scoliosis correction\n\nWe developed a novel 3D scoliosis correction system by modifying the traditional spinal traction equipment, which was originally designed for managing patients with low back pain. The apparatus consisted of a control platform, a longitudinal traction cable, a transverse 3-point correction component, and an axial rotational adjustment device on a treatment bed. \n\nThe system operated by alternately applying the corrective forces of longitudinal traction, transverse 3-point forces, and derotational forces. It could be applied to correct various types of scoliotic curvature with different Cobb angles. The operation procedures included: (1) positioning the patient with AIS on the treatment bed in standing position; (2) using the electric controls to transit the patient into supine position on the treatment bed; (3) securing and linking the pelvic and trunk regions to the traction cable; (4) initiating the longitudinal traction with a force not exceeding 50% of the patient's body weight 31 ; (5) once the maximal longitudinal traction was reached, adjusting the location of the transverse 3-point pressure pads on both sides (applying the corrective forces to the apex and upper and lower end vertebrae of the curvature while simultaneously adjusting the height of the lateral force rods and the inflation of airbags on both sides of the bed to correct spinal rotation) 32 ; (6) entering a 30-minute cyclic scoliosis correction phase (via 15 repetitions of a cyclic alternating force application: longitudinal traction gradually decreased over 1 minute and 50 seconds, while the transverse 3-point correction component's airbags started to inflate, and when the traction force completely decreased to 0 N in the end of the 2 minutes, the lateral correction device's airbags started to inflate to their maximum values in 1 minute and 50 seconds, followed by deflation, at which point the longitudinal traction force started to increase again for a new cycle). The whole correction treatment was carried out under the principles of gradual force progress and safety, with an emergency button being provided for patients to immediately pause the mechanical correction procedure in any exceptional circumstances. \n\nSubjects\n\nA total of 40 subjects, diagnosed with AIS by an orthopedic surgeon, participated in this study. All subjects were recruited from the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine Engineering at the affiliated teaching hospital of a university from August 2022 to March 2023. Inclusion criteria were (1) aged 10-18 years; (2) Cobb angle between 20°and 45°. Exclusion criteria included those who (1) received the treatments of braces or physiotherapy scoliosis-specific exercise within 6 months before this study; (2) had an intellectual impairment and inability to understand the instructions; (3) were unable to perform the sit and reach test. This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the hospital and was registered in the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. All participants and guardians signed the written informed consent form before participating in this study. \n\nMeasurement of Cobb angle\n\nEach AIS participant's main Cobb angle was measured in this study. The entire spinal column of each subject was X-rayed in the anterior−posterior direction in a standing position. The Cobb method was used to measure the degree of scoliosis, which was performed by the same physiotherapist experienced in scoliosis assessment. \n\nRandomization, intervention allocation, and blinding\n\nSubjects were assigned (in a 1:1 ratio) to the intervention group (IG) (receiving 30min mechanical 3D scoliosis correction treatment, 20 subjects) and exercise group (EG) (receiving 30min Schroth exercise treatment, 20 subjects) randomly. Randomization was performed using a table of random numbers generated by a blinded investigator with SPSS 16.00 a . Participants were assigned to their respective groups based on the enrolment order and corresponding random numbers. No stratification factors (such as sex, maturity level, or curve type) were used in the randomization process. All the investigators and the statistical analysts were blinded to group assignment, and all participants promised never to tell their interventions to anybody. \n\nIntervention Mechanical 3D scoliosis correction\n\nBefore receiving the mechanical 3D scoliosis correction, each participant's body height and weight were measured to calculate the required longitudinal traction force. Subsequently, participants wore a pelvic fixation belt and lay in a supine position on a traction bed (fig 1a). The traction bed was equipped with traction belts that could fix the participants under the participant's arms. Once the traction program began, the longitudinal traction force would be applied to the participant's spine at the level of the shoulder and pelvis. After this, the physical therapist manually adjusted the lateral force rod to apply the lateral corrective force. The applied lateral force was customized based on the participant's individual radiograph images and following the guideline of the 3-point pressure system, with the corrective force applied to the apex vertebra and the stabilizing/reactive forces applied to the end vertebrae. The magnitude of the lateral corrective force was adjusted based on the participant's pain perception, by providing the largest corrective force that each participant could tolerate. Each mechanical 3D scoliosis correction procedure lasted for approximately 30 minutes. During the mechanical 3D scoliosis correction, if participants experienced any pain, the therapist would adjust and reduce the lateral corrective force with reference to the pain threshold. All participants in the IG underwent a complete mechanical 3D scoliosis correction procedure. 33 \n\nSchroth exercise\n\nAs shown in figure 1b, the participants in EG received a 30minute Schroth best practice (SBP) exercise session, guided by an SBP-certified physical therapist with more than 3 years of clinical experience. The SBP session mainly involved Physiologic exercises, instruction in the activities of daily living, 3D made easy program, \"Power Schroth\" exercises, rehabilitation of walking, and de-tethering exercises. 34 Each 30minute training session consisted of 5-minute derotation breathing training and 25-minute \"Power Schroth\" exercises, specifically featuring the frog on the pond, 50X, and muscle cylinder. Before the exercise session, the therapist evaluated each participant's scoliosis curve type based on the Lehnert-Schroth classification (3-or 4-curve) first, and then made the necessary adjustments to the detailed exercise elements and protocol for each participant accordingly. During the training process, the therapist would make adjustments to the exercise in real time based on the participants' physical condition, learning pace, and ability to perform the exercise. These adjustments included fine-tuning posture and positioning or modifying the focus of the session to align with the participant's individual needs. All adjustments adhered to the standardized procedures outlined in the SBP exercise manual. 34 \n\nOutcome measure\n\nAll outcome measures were assessed at baseline and immediately after completing the intervention. The primary outcome measure was spinal flexibility, which was assessed using the sit and reach test, lateral bending test, and trunk rotation test. The secondary outcome measure was the changes in body height. \n\nSit and reach test\n\nThe sit and reach test was used to evaluate the patient's forward bending (FB) flexibility. This test was conducted using the sit and reach tester, with the subject sitting on the floor with both legs straight and feet stepping on the vertical flat surface of the tester (by putting the heels together and toes apart for about 10-15cm). 35 Participants were then instructed to put their arms and hands straight, gradually flex the trunk to reach forward, and then use the fingertips of both hands to gently push the Vernier on the scale to make it slide forward until it could not continue to move. The participant should not have any sudden forward movement while performing this test. The inner plane of the stirrups of the test gauge was the 0 point, with the inward movements documented as the negative value and the forward movement documented as the positive value. The measurement was recorded in centimeters with 1 decimal point. The range of the tester was from À20.0 to +30.0 cm, with a \"+\" sign for positive and a \"À\" sign for negative values (figs 2a and b). \n\nLateral bending test\n\nTo perform this test, participants were instructed to stand up straight with the feet together, keeping the body against a wall, and arms close to the sides of the body. 36 Participants were then instructed to lean the trunk to one side and keep the trunk close to the wall until reaching the limit. The \n\nTrunk rotation test\n\nDuring the test, participants were instructed to sit in the center of a modified goniometer platform as designed by a previous study. 37 Participants were then instructed to hold their head in a neutral position with the chin tucked, flex the knees and hip joints for approximately 90°, and keep the arms straight forward. Then, the therapist provided the verbal instructions of \"Keep your trunk upright,\" \"Don't raise your shoulders,\" \"Keep your arms straight,\" \"Turn your head with hands,\" and \"Don't lift your pelvis.\" Subjects were asked to keep their trunk at the maximal lateral rotation (to the left or right sides) for about 3 seconds (figs 2e and f). \n\nBody height assessment\n\nThe participant's body height was measured using an ultrasonic height tester. 38 \n\nData and statistical analysis\n\nData and statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS 16.00 a software package. The descriptive analysis results were reported using the mean § SD and median (interquartile range [IQR]) values. Categorical data were expressed as frequencies [n (%)]. The distribution normality of the measured variables was calculated using the Shapiro−Wilk test. According to the results, all the data conformed to the nonnormal distribution and thus were analyzed using nonparametric tests. Categorical variables, such as sex and curve type, were compared between the 2 groups using the Chi-square test. The Wilcoxon signedrank test was performed to compare the within-group results before and after the intervention (ie, pre-intervention vs post-intervention), whereas the Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney test was performed for between-group comparison (ie, IG vs EG). A P value of <.05 was determined as statistically significant. \n\nResults\n\nStudy population\n\nAs shown in figure 3, a total of 40 (out of 57) subjects with AIS met the inclusion/exclusion criteria and were included in the data analysis of this study. Of the excluded 17 subjects, 13 of them did not meet the inclusion criteria, and the rest of the 4 refused to participate in the study. No subject dropped out during the follow-up. \n\nThe 40 eligible subjects with AIS (70.2%) were randomly assigned to the IG (n=20) or the EG (n=20). The results showed that the 2 groups were well-balanced at baseline, with no significant difference in the subject characteristics of age, sex, Cobb angle of the thoracic curve, or Cobb angle of the lumbar curve (table 1). \n\nWithin-group comparison of spinal flexibility and body height: Before intervention versus after intervention\n\nAs shown in figure 4 and supplemental appendix S1 (available online only at http://www.archives-pmr.org/), significant improvements were observed in FB and left trunk rotation (LTR)/right trunk rotation (RTR) test results in participants of both IG and EG before and after the intervention (P≤.028). In addition, the IG participants further showed significant improvements in left lateral bending (LLB)/right lateral bending (RLB) test results (P≤.012), whereas the EG participants did not exhibit significant differences in neither the LLB (P=.623) nor the RLB (P=.147) test results. The IG participants also demonstrated a noteworthy increase in body height (P<.001), whereas no significant difference was observed in the EG participants for the body height (P=.784). \n\nBetween-group comparison of spinal flexibility and body height: IG versus EG\n\nAs shown in figure 5 and table 2, although there was no significant difference between the 2 groups in the changes in spinal flexibility, there was a significantly larger increase in body height after the intervention (P<.001) in the IG participants (1.0 §0.6cm; 0.8 [0.7-1.2]) than that of the EG participants (À0.2 §0.5cm; À0.2 [À0.5 to 0.1]). \n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study provided an innovative approach by modifying the traditional spinal traction devices into a novel digitalized 3D scoliosis correction system, which can be applied to implement a novel mechanical 3D scoliosis correction protocol for patients with AIS. \n\nThe newly developed mechanical 3D scoliosis correction protocol has been identified as demonstrating potential improvements in the side-bending spinal flexibility of patients with AIS, after 1 session of the mechanical 3D scoliosis correction. The spinal flexibility was assessed in AIS participants by measuring the changes in the range of FB, lateral bending, and trunk rotation in sitting and standing positions. These measurements significantly improved with the implementation of the newly developed mechanical 3D scoliosis correction protocol. Such positive results were also supported by the significant increase in body height among the AIS participants, which might indicate the reduced Cobb angle in participants as suggested in a previous study. 38 However, it should be noted that these outcome measures were non-specific and could not exclude the movements that were generated by multiple joints and elements other than the spine. The observed positive result may not reject the possibility that the body was following more of the scoliosis pattern after the intervention. Future studies shall use some radiation-free imaging technologies, such as the 3D ultrasound assessment of scoliosis, 39 to verify this anticipation. \n\nThe system to implement the mechanical 3D scoliosis correction was developed by combining the longitudinal spinal   32 The results of the current study have further supported that such a system could also be used to improve the spinal flexibility of patients with AIS nonsurgically. The advantages of the developed system were that it could improve spinal flexibility and correct scoliosis curvature, by enabling the simultaneous application of the longitudinal traction and the transverse 3-point corrective forces throughout the treatment process, whereas it might be challenging and difficult for the physical exercise to maintain such level of correction consistently. It should be noted that the developed system had alternate elongation and derotation phases, instead of simultaneous correction. This could not fulfill the need that a good correction design following the 3-point pressure system shall provide the correction force that covers all 3 planes simultaneously. Future attempts will be put on optimizing the device by integrating multiplanar corrective forces simultaneously. \n\nThe results corroborated the finding that Schroth exercises can effectively improve the trunk FB flexibility of patients with scoliosis and further demonstrated that such exercise could improve the LTR/RTR ranges but not the LLB/ RLB ranges, which have not been reported previously. Lai et al 40 reported that the spinal deformities reduced the forward flexibility of the lumbar spine in patients with idiopathic scoliosis. A previous study has also applied the Schroth and suspension exercises in patients with scoliosis and observed significant differences in flexibility, strength, and balance abilities after the intervention. 41 However, only the sit and reach test was used to assess the FB flexibility of participants in that study. Jorgi c et al 42 also used the sit and reach test to evaluate the effect of the Schroth exercise and observed that the Schroth exercise could enhance motor function, lumbar extensor flexibility, and isometric Table 2 The between-group comparison of changes before and after intervention in AIS participants (n=40) \n\nIG (n=20) 1.9 §1.8; 1.6 (0.5-3.3) \n\nÀ1.1 §2.2; À1.0 (À1.9 to À0. endurance among children with idiopathic scoliosis. To our knowledge, none of the previous studies have investigated the changes in the range of lateral bending and rotation of the trunk in patients with AIS on completing the Schroth exercises. The results of the present study filled such a research gap and supported that a 30-minute Schroth exercise could also improve the LTR/RTR ranges but not for the LLB/RLB ranges in patients with AIS. \n\nThe positive results and the innovative protocol of combining the longitudinal traction force, coronal 3-point pressure, and derotation force in 1 system might provide a new conservative scoliosis treatment. Most existing guidelines recommended that the criteria for determining the effectiveness of brace therapy were to maintain the current Cobb angle without progression or to reduce it by 5°-10°. 43 However, it has been a great challenge to achieve such Cobb angle reduction for moderate scoliosis, especially to sustain such reduction beyond the adolescent period, because the higher the Cobb angle, the higher the risk of progression in scoliosis patients. 44 The positive effect may be achieved by wearing a spinal brace in patients with AIS with moderate curvature (20°≤Cobb angle≤45°), depending on the type and location of scoliosis. However, it has been difficult to use bracing treatment to correct the severe curvature (Cobb angle>45°), due to the biomechanical principle that the elongating forces would be equal to the compressing forces longitudinally when the curvature reached an angle of 45°. This is also why most patients with scoliosis with severe curvature (Cobb angle>45°) were not prescribed with conservative treatments. It has been reported that the effect of simply applying the transverse 3-point pressure/force might be limited to correct severe scoliosis with a Cobb angle of > 53°. 17 Although a recent previous study has explored the possibility and reported positive results of using the bracing treatment together with the instrumented corrective exercise to correct the spinal deformity of patients with AIS, 45 the current pilot study further identified that it is also feasible (with preliminary effectiveness) to combine the longitudinal traction force, coronal 3-point pressure, and derotation force in one system to achieve the mechanical 3D scoliosis correction for patients with AIS. The developed mechanical 3D scoliosis correction protocol might be prescribed for patients for a period of time to improve their spinal flexibility and/or reduce their scoliosis curvature first, followed by the fitting of the spinal braces to maintain the achieved improvement of spinal flexibility and correction/ reduction of scoliosis curvature. This could expand the scope of conservative scoliosis treatments. It would also be interesting and worthwhile to explore these potential aspects and hypotheses in future studies. For example, in cases where the Cobb angle was larger than 20°or even 45°, the conventional application of applying the transverse or longitudinal forces alone may be of limited effectiveness. Future studies may consider exploring the potential benefits of using the mechanical 3D scoliosis correction as a preparatory treatment before the fitting of the brace, which may help broaden the scope of conservative scoliosis treatment. Further clinical research, with a focus on optimizing and improving the system and the protocol, is still needed to determine the optimal treatment duration, method of force application, and alternating force intervals, to provide a more scientific and effective treatment for patients with scoliosis. \n\nStudy limitations\n\nSeveral limitations must be acknowledged for this pilot study, with some findings that need to be interpreted with caution. First, this was a relatively small scale clinical study with a small sample size. This may lead to low statistical power and nonsignificant statistical results for the baseline demographics of the 2 subject groups, despite the noticeable between-group differences. Future studies will increase the sample size and consider matched analyses to address this issue. Second, only one session of the intervention was investigated, which may affect the generalization of its effectiveness in this study. Future studies will consider investigating and comparing the long-term effects and differences of the exercise on patient's spinal flexibility between the 2 interventions. Third, the developed digitalized 3D spinal correction machine had alternate elongation and derotation phases, instead of simultaneous correction. This could not fulfill the need that a good correction design after the 3-point pressure system shall provide correction force that covers all 3 planes simultaneously. Future attempts will be put on optimizing the device by integrating multiplanar corrective forces simultaneously. Fourth, this study mainly recruited patients aged between 10 and 18 years and did not collect information on the patient's maturity level. It should be noted that the maturity level and growth potential are more important than the actual chronological age when it comes to treatment response in patients with AIS. Future studies will consider incorporating these indicators to improve the selection of participants and enhance the robustness of study findings. The relation of the outcome to a specific maturity level will also be conducted in the future. Fifth, this study did not conduct a subtype analysis of how different curve types responded to treatment, which is crucial for a comprehensive evaluation. Future studies can perform such analyses to facilitate a comprehensive evaluation that can guide future clinical practice. Sixth, the intervention group participants were passively lying in the supine position, which unloaded the spine for approximately 30 minutes. This may relax the spine and contribute to the observed increase in body height. Future studies will include a new blank control group in which the participants keep the same lying position for 30 minutes, without activating the machine, to further verify the results. Seventh, although the intervention group participants were in the supine position, the control/exercise group participants were in the upright position. The upright position may increase the curve magnitude under the influence of gravity, compared to the supine lying position. This may further affect the interpretation of the observed difference in body height between the 2 groups. Future studies could further control the body position of different groups and adopt supine-based Schroth exercises, to ensure greater consistency and accuracy in assessing the intervention's effects. Eighth, the positive results from the sit and reach, lateral bending, and trunk rotation tests have suggested improvements in spinal flexibility after the interventions. However, it should be noted that these outcome measures were nonspecific and could not exclude the movements that were generated by multiple joints and elements other than the spine. The observed positive result may not reject the possibility that the body was following more of the scoliosis pattern after the intervention. Future studies should consider involving more specific outcome measures of spinal flexibility, such as the side-bending and fulcrum-bending tests, with validation from the imaging measurements. 27 inth, the observed improvements in testing scores may be due to the learning effect in participants. In addition to the randomization of participants that was adopted in the current study, it is also suggested to employ the blocking of the interventions in future studies to further address this issue. The spacing technique is also recommended to increase the duration of time interval between the baseline assessments, interventions, and the post-intervention assessments. More large and higher quality clinical studies with a long-term treatment will be conducted to verify the effectiveness of the developed mechanical 3D scoliosis correction protocol in improving scoliosis flexibility and reducing scoliosis curvature in patients with AIS. \n\nConclusions\n\nThe newly developed mechanical 3D scoliosis correction protocol showed preliminary feasibility and effectiveness in instantly improving the side-bending spinal flexibility and the body height of patients with AIS, as assessed by measuring the changes in the range of FB, lateral bending, and trunk rotation. This protocol could provide a new conservative scoliosis treatment option, by combining the longitudinal traction force, coronal 3-point pressure, and derotation force in one digitalized system. However, further efforts are still needed to explore whether such treatment protocol could treat patients with scoliosis with special apex vertebra position, obesity, and large Cobb angle (eg, >45°), who are facing challenges in achieving satisfactory treatment outcomes/prognosis with the existing conventional conservative treatment options.

INTRODUCTION\n\nQ UANTUM computing has emerged as a groundbreaking paradigm with the potential to revolutionize various fields, such as cryptography, machine learning, and optimization [1]- [3], thanks to the use of quantum properties such as entanglement and superposition. \n\nQuantum computers [4] are currently constrained by a limited number of qubits. Even the most advanced quantum processors comprise only a few hundred qubits [5]. To unleash the total computational power and achieve universal fault tolerance, scaling up quantum computers while ensuring minimal increments in error rates becomes imperative. Nowadays, quantum computers are designed as single-chip processors, known as single-core quantum processors, containing all qubits within a single chip. This monolithic architecture encounters challenges in scalability due to the undesirable rise in qubit interactions, leading to issues like crosstalk [6]. To overcome these limitations, alternative approaches are sought, aiming to expand qubit counts and enhance scalability for future quantum systems. \n\nA feasible approach for scaling quantum computers is to go from a monolithic quantum computer to a multi-core ap-P.

With the emergence of modular quantum computing architectures, new challenges arise, particularly in mapping quantum algorithms onto physical quantum devices. This compilation process is crucial for adapting a quantum algorithm to run efficiently on the desired quantum architecture, making it a central aspect of this cutting-edge technology. Figure 1 depicts a valid (right) and an invalid (left) mapping of qubits into cores for a four-core quantum architecture. Few multi-core oriented mapping algorithms [12]- [14] have been developed to address these challenges, with strong assumptions on the cores' constraints. Their optimality in mapping quantum algorithms across multiple cores has not been rigorously examined. We propose an alternative multicore mapping algorithm based on the observed limitations of current mapping techniques for multi-core architectures. It is designed to achieve fewer inter-core communications, facilitating improved scalability and performance. The performance of the proposed inter-core mapping algorithm is rigorously compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches. \n\nII. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK\n\nTo solve the scalability problem, several multi-core approaches have been proposed [5], [7]- [11]. The main goal is to increase the computational power of the quantum processor without increasing the crosstalk between qubits by having different quantum processors (or cores) connected via classical links (early stages) or by coherent quantum links (later stages). \n\nIn multi-core architectures, many challenges arise, particularly in executing two-qubit gates involving qubits physically situated on different quantum processors, as illustrated in Figure 1. It is possible to perform two-qubit gates between distant qubits in different chips under specific practical conditions [15]. However, the fidelity of inter-chip links is lower compared to intra-chip links. \n\nNonetheless, irrespective of the specific implementation approach, the overarching challenge lies in optimizing the number of non-local communications. This is essential for minimizing unnecessary actions, enhancing gate fidelity, and maximizing the efficiency of quantum computations. Various inter-core communications protocols to perform two-qubit gates exist, including remote gate operations and the transfer of quantum states followed by local gate executions. \n\nIn the context of our paper, we focus on the multi-core architecture model proposed by Rodrigo et al. in [10]. This model suggests using a maximally entangled state, often called an EPR pair, as a foundational communications resource to facilitate the transmission of quantum states between cores. The communication protocol employed in this model, known as quantum teleportation, provides an efficient means to transfer quantum information between cores while leveraging classical communications. \n\nA. FGP-rOEE\n\nThis section reviews the inter-core mapping algorithm proposed in [12], called Fine Grained Partitioning (FGP-rOEE), which is one of the scarce algorithms proposed so far to solve the mapping problem for multi-core quantum computers. Other mapping algorithms, such as [13] and [14], use EPR pairs for remote operations apart from teleportation. \n\nThe FGP-rOEE algorithm takes as inputs a quantum circuit with q qubits and an architecture with N cores, each one containing q N qubits. Two assumptions are made: i) The coupling map of each core is all-to-all; i.e., all qubits in a core have direct connections to one another, allowing the direct execution of a two-qubit gate if both qubits are located within the same core. ii) Cores are interconnected all-to-all, enabling the exchange of quantum states between any pair of cores. \n\nThe algorithm's goal is to obtain a sequence of assignments of qubits to cores, one assignment per timeslice (the set of quantum gates that can be executed in parallel). The circuit is separated into timeslices, and for each of them, a valid assignment of qubits to cores is found. A valid assignment must have every pair of interacting qubits in the timeslice assigned to the same core, so no two-qubit gate involves qubits located in different cores. \n\nFor a given timeslice t, FGP-rOEE computes the interaction graph of that timeslice, a graph with the qubits as nodes and an edge between two nodes if the qubits interact with each other in future timeslices. The edges are weighted, representing the immediacy of the interaction. These weights are called lookahead weights and are computed using Equation (1), where I(m, q i , q j ) = 1 if qubits q i and q j interact at timeslice m, and the exponential decay function is used so nearby timeslices have more impact on the look-ahead weights than latter ones. \n\nFor qubits that interact exactly at timeslice t, a weight of infinity is set to the edges since, at that timeslice, they must be in the same core. \n\nA k-partitioning algorithm is then applied to the interaction graph, partitioning the graph into k disjoint subsets of nodes. \n\nFor our case, k equals the number of cores N , and it is a requirement that all partitions have the exact same size, as cores have a fixed size, and we can only assign q N qubits into each core. Because of these requirements, the number of available k-partitioning algorithms is scarce. \n\nIn [12], the use of the Overall Extreme Exchange (OEE) algorithm [16] is proposed. The OEE algorithm builds upon the Kernighan-Lin (KL) algorithm and expands its capabilities. In OEE, the process begins with an initial configuration of qubits, and a pair of qubits is selected for sequential exchange. This selection is based on optimizing the minimized exchange cost for the current exchange. If the exchange cost remains positive, further exchanges are performed in an attempt to improve the configuration. The algorithm terminates if the exchange cost becomes zero or negative, indicating no further improvement can be achieved. In [12], a variation of the OEE algorithm is proposed, the rOEE or relaxed Overall Extreme Exchange. rOEE also starts with an assignment and performs exchanges of nodes until a valid partition is reached (i.e. all interacting qubits are in the same partition). \n\nThis procedure is repeated for every pair of timeslices, using the previous assignment of qubits to cores as input for the rOEE algorithm. With this, a path of valid assignments is found over the whole circuit. \n\nIII. HUNGARIAN QUBIT ASSIGNMENT\n\nIn this section, we propose an alternative inter-core mapper to FGP-rOEE. Similar to FGP-rOEE, the Hungarian Qubit Assignment (HQA) describes how to assign qubits to cores in between timeslices and is generalized to map the whole algorithm. However, instead of distributing qubits into cores, this algorithm distributes two-qubit operations into cores, a much easier task than the former. As each two-qubit operation within a timeslice involves two distinct qubits, the algorithm's output will be a valid assignment for that particular timeslice. \n\nA. General Overview\n\nWe start with a valid assignment of qubits to cores for timeslice t. The following timeslice (t + 1) has a set of unfeasible two-qubit gates involving qubits that are currently located in different cores. This is depicted in Figure 1 (left), where we can see five unfeasible two-qubit operations for an example architecture of four cores. \n\nThe qubits involved in the unfeasible two-qubit operations are then removed from the assignment and placed in an auxiliary vector of unassigned qubits. Now, the task is to assign each operation to a core with enough space to take in the qubits. For this assignment, we will construct a cost matrix using the cost function in Equation ( 2), which assigns a cost C t to each pair of unfeasible two-qubit operation op i and core c j based on how many non-local communications are needed to place both qubits involved in the operation q A , q B into the destination core c j (i.e. one if a qubit involved in the two-qubit gate is already placed in the core, two otherwise). \n\nThe cost matrix is used to assign a single operation to each core. To do so, we use the Hungarian algorithm [17], a highly efficient linear assignment algorithm with polynomial time complexity (O(n 3 )). Its versatility, simple implementation, and robustness make it a favoured choice in various fields, especially when a quadratic algorithm is impractical. \n\nThe goal of the assignment problem is to find the best way to assign a set of tasks (cores) to a group of resources (unfeasible two-qubit operations) while minimizing the total cost. By doing this, at each iteration, only one operation will be assigned to each core, ensuring the core's size is not exceeded. \n\nWhen an operation is assigned to a core, both qubits involved are placed in the free spaces of the core. Therefore, the number of free spaces in the core decreases by two every time an operation is assigned to it. Placing both qubits in each operation into the same core ensures all two-qubit gates will be feasible in the following timeslice. \n\nWhen having more operations than cores, the Hungarian algorithm only assigns one operation per core, so some operations will remain unassigned. A new cost matrix will be computed for those unassigned operations, considering the new free spaces of each core, setting a weight of infinity for those cores already full. By doing this, we ensure that no core exceeds its capacity and that the resulting assignment will be valid. Iteratively, the cost matrix is computed, and one twoqubit operation is assigned to each core with free space until all qubits are assigned to a core. \n\nEach core must contain an even number of qubits interacting in unfeasible two-qubit gates for this approach to work. Otherwise, when assigning operations into cores, there will be a pair of qubits left to assign and two cores with exactly one free space each, making it impossible to assign an operation to the core. An auxiliary two-qubit gate involving two noninteracting qubits from the cores with an odd number of qubits involved in unfeasible operations is created to solve this, ensuring that all cores contain an even number of free spaces and that all two-qubit operations will be allocated. \n\nB. Considering future qubit interactions\n\nFuture interactions of qubits can be added to the cost matrix to perform an assignment that further reduces the number of non-local communications. To this end, we quantify how much qubits interact in future timeslices using the same approach as in [12], described in Equation (1). In particular, the attraction force of a qubit q i to a core c j is computed as \n\nwhere J t (q i ′ , c j ) = 1 if qubit q i ′ is in core c j at timeslice t, and w t (q i , q i ′ ) is computed using Eq. ( 1). \n\nThe new cost matrix is then computed using the costs given in Equation (5), where the number of non-local communications needed and the attraction forces are combined. Note that, as each operation op i involves two qubits (q A and q B ), the operation's attraction force to a core is the average attraction force of the involved qubits. \n\nThe proposed approach cost function is completely tunable, allowing for more complex variations of the problem. For example, if not all cores are connected to each other, the number of non-local communications to move a qubit to a given core may be more than one. The cost function can be adapted to this case, and many others, leading to a robust and widely applicable inter-core mapping algorithm. \n\nIV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nIn this section, we compare the state-of-the-art inter-core mapper (FGP-rOEE) and the proposed approach (HQA), using the number of inter-core communications as the evaluation metric (the lower, the better). For this evaluation, we will partition various quantum algorithms into modular architectures, varying the number of qubits and cores. The selected benchmarks encompass a wide variety of quantum algorithms, including Quantum Random Circuit (with varying two-qubit gate densities), GHZ State Preparation, Cuccaro Adder, Quantum Fourier Transform, Quantum Volume, and Grover's Algorithm. This diverse set of benchmarks ensures a comprehensive assessment of the mapping algorithms' performance across different quantum computation scenarios. \n\nAlgorithms are implemented using OpenQL [18], as in [10]. They are divided into time slices and partitioned using both state-of-the-art and our proposed method. The number of non-local communications is calculated, and the ratio of our approach to the state-of-the-art indicates optimization (ratio > 1) or diminished performance (ratio < 1). For the HQA, the cost function considering future qubit interactions (defined in Equation ( 5)) is selected, as it achieves a lower number of communications than its counterpart (Equation ( 2)). Such comparison is depicted in Figure 2. No Attr / Attr Ratio Fig. 2. HQA communications with and without using the attraction force, mapped into an architecture with 16 qubits per core and as many cores as needed, depending on the number of qubits used (x-axis). A structured circuit (Cuccaro Adder) and an unstructured one (Random) have been selected to highlight the importance of the attraction force. The box plot depicts the Cuccaro Adder communications ratio with the two approaches. \n\nThe performance of the mapping algorithms is assessed through two scalability approaches: one involves increasing the number of cores in a fixed-size architecture, while the other entails expanding the number of qubits in an architecture with a fixed number of cores. \n\nIn Figure 3, we show the ratio of non-local communications needed when having a fixed-size circuit (120 qubits) and mapping it into a modular architecture with a varying number of cores. Note that the number of qubits per core is also conditioned on the number of cores of the architecture since the total number of qubits matches the circuit's size. \n\nDespite, for some cases, having a higher number of nonlocal communications (ratio < 1.0), HQA exhibits superior performance compared to FGP-rOEE, achieving improvements up to ∼ 3.4× and an overall average improvement of ∼ 1.3×. Fig. 3. FGP-rOEE and HQA non-local communications ratio for the selected benchmarks, when mapping the 120-qubits into different modular architectures. Each bar represents the number of cores in the architecture, and it is selected such that each core contains the same number of qubits and ensures an even number of qubits per core. This criterion is essential to ensure the feasibility of assigning two-qubit gates within the chosen core configuration. \n\nFigure 4 shows the number of non-local communications needed to map the selected benchmarking algorithms into a 10core architecture when increasing the total number of qubits and, therefore, the number of qubits per core. Fig. 4. FGP-rOEE and HQA non-local communications ratio for the selected benchmarks, mapped into a 10-core architecture, when increasing the total number of qubits in the architecture. \n\nIt can be seen that, for both scaling approaches, the proposed algorithm usually outperforms the state-of-the-art mapping algorithm, obtaining a lower number of non-local communications, an essential aspect of multi-core quantum compilation. Unlike most benchmarks, the HQA performs worse than FGP-rOEE when mapping the GHZ circuit. We estimate this is due to the edge-case structure the GHZ circuit has, where one single qubit interacts with all other qubits sequentially. In such cases, a mapping algorithm that uses a partitioning approach instead of an assignment approach performs better. \n\nIt is worth mentioning that the attraction force for HQA has been designed to match the information used in FGP-rOEE by using the same look-ahead weights. However, several lookahead functions are evaluated in [12], and the best-performing one is selected. Therefore, tuning the attraction force of the proposed approach has the potential to decrease the number of non-local communications even further. \n\nV. CONCLUSIONS\n\nModular approaches are envisioned to appear very soon in quantum computers, bringing new challenges in compiling quantum algorithms to be adapted to modular architectures. In this work, we have proposed an algorithm to distribute, along the circuit, each qubit to a partition so each twoqubit gate can be executed. The proposed algorithm produces assignments based on simplified premises than other modulararchitecture mappers, as based on the assignments of unfeasible two-qubit gates into cores, instead of partitioning the interaction graph, as it was done by [12]. By doing this, a lower number of non-local communications between cores is achieved, improving the mapping of the quantum algorithm. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is highly customizable, allowing for a different topology among cores (not only all-toall connectivity). A different definition of the attraction force of qubits to cores can be proposed, for this work, we have used the same information that FGP-rOEE use. \n", "annotations": {"sentence":

The picture of aging is characterized by genetic and environmental factors ultimately leading to gradual but persistent reduction in cellular proliferation, abnormal oxygen metabolism, and structural instability [2]. A complex gene network contributes to organism lifespan by regulating several critical pathways including protein synthesis and catabolism, energy metabolism, redox balance, intracellular communication, DNA repair, inflammation, cellular senescence, and death [3]. The aging process also involves the vascular system. In this context, cell senescence involving either endothelial cells (ECs) or vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) [4] determines structural and functional alterations resulting in development of endothelial dysfunction [5]. Previous researches identified several molecules and signaling pathways involved in the aging process: among them, growth hormone (GH)/insulin-like growth factor 1(IGF1)/forkhead box O (FOXO) pathway, target of rapamycin (TOR)/ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K), sirtuins (Sirts), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) [6][7][8]. Despite many efforts in clarifying the biology of aging and its cellular and molecular mechanisms, standardized biomarkers and therapeutic targets are scarce. Only several senotherapeutics, agents which inhibit senescence (senomorphics) and selectively kill senescent cells (senolytics), have been proposed. Senolytics are drugs that particularly target senescent cells through promoting the apoptosis of senescence [9][10][11]. \n\nIn this field of research, there is a growing interest towards the natural compound curcumin (CUR; diferuloylmethane), which is known as an active therapeutic compound against various human disorders owing to its numerous pharmacological actions [12][13][14][15][16][17]. In light of this, research groups worldwide are attempting to clarify biological pathways, pharmaceutical properties, and potential clinical application of CUR [18]. In this narrative review, we will summarize the therapeutic potential of CUR, especially focusing on prevention and delaying of the aging process. \n\nHallmarks of Aging\n\n2.1. Oxidative Stress. A prooxidant environment certainly contributes to the aging process by sustaining oxidative modifications of cellular molecules [19][20][21]. Targets of oxidative stress (OS) include structural damage in cellular macromolecules such as nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, proteins, and lipids [22]. Nevertheless, the \"free radical theory of aging\" is no longer considered a primitive causal pathway. Free radicals and related oxidants are a subset of stressors with which all living beings must cope with over their lifespans. Rather, the concept of \"defective adaptive homeostasis\" better describes how aging organisms fail to dynamically expand the homeostatic range of stress defense and repair systems. Indeed, many signal transduction pathways contribute to best fit cellular response to a particular need. \n\nCellular\n\nSenescence. Cellular response to stressors includes three distinctive cellular processes: apoptosis, autophagy, and senescence [23][24][25]. The latter (from the latin term \"senex\": growing old) occurs in response to enormous intracellular or extracellular stress stimuli [26]. Cellular senescence was firstly described by Hayflick and Moorhead [27] as an antiproliferative process leading to permanent cell cycle arrest lifespan reduction [25]. Such effect on the biological clock (Hayflick limit) is generally associated with progressive telomere attrition/dysfunction [28,29], loss of proteostasis, induction of genes located in the INK4a/ARF locus [30], aberrant oncogene activation, DNA damage during cell division/replication, and apoptosisresistance [31]. Leading mediators of cellular senescence include the p16 INK4a/Rb and tumor suppressor p53/p21 CIP1/WAF1 families of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) [32]. Senescent cells endure futile growth, hypertrophy, and hyperfunctions, together with generation and release of inflammatory mediators named senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) [33,34]. SASP includes multiple inflammatory elements such as interleukin-(IL-) 6, IL-8, IL-1, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), and growth factors like insulin-like growth factor-(IGF-) 1, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) [35,36]. \n\nAlongside SASP, the core event in cellular senescence cell nucleus are the disturbances in DNA repair mechanisms, which determine DNA double-strand breaks senescenceassociated heterochromatin foci (SAHF), terminal cell cycle arrest with resistance to apoptosis, and loss of regeneration/resilience [37]. Additional features include enlarged lysosomes, overexpression of senescence associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal), and lipofuscin granularity as well. A relevant feature of aging is chronic low grade inflammation, referred to as \"inflammaging\" which is the age-related inflammatory status, results from immunosenescence, as it is found to be associated with the majority of age-related diseases sharing an inflammatory basis [38]. Together with immunological elements, cellular senescence and the SASP are the major contributors to inflammaging. \n\nThat cellular senescence may have a causative role in organismal aging [39]. During aging, senescent cells are possibly persistent, activated by random molecular damage and related with the activation of a DNA damage response [40]. The collection of senescent cells in animal organs may be involved in the aging process through reducing the renewal competence of tissues [30] and/or via reforming the tissue structure and activity by secretion of matrix metalloproteinases, epithelial growth factors, and inflammatory mediators which could intrude with the tissue microenvironment [41]. Therefore, tissue homeostasis will be compromised which finally will result to aging. \n\n2.3. Sirtuins. Sirtuins are NAD+-dependent deacetylases, ubiquitously distributed in either prokaryote or eukaryote cells [42]. In mammalians, 7 Sirt genes (Sirt1 to Sirt7) have been identified. Sirt1 belongs to the class III histone deacetylases (HDAC) with activity on various transcriptional factors (TFs), histones, and cytoplasmic proteins with acyl-lysine residues [43]. Antiaging properties of Sirt1 include the suppression of a typical senescent secretome through epigenetic gene modulation [44]. However, the antiaging effects of Sirt1 are far from being elucidated, potentially ranging from mitochondrial respiration to stress modulation, energy expenditure, and p53 deacetylation [37,45]. \n\nCurcumin\n\nDue to their ubiquitous distribution in food, phytochemicals attract more attention because of their obvious safety. Accumulating evidences reported how phytochemicals that can extend lifespan also enhance wellness in different heterotrophic organisms [46][47][48][49]. The hydrophobic yellow polyphenol CUR is a bioactive chemical constituent of the rhizome of Curcuma longa Linn, extensively used in cooking as food coloring and preservative. CUR is the main chief ingredient of turmeric representing nearly 2-5% of the plant [50]. Toxicity studies claimed it is a safe compound agent even at high doses [51]. Concerning effectiveness, several lines of evidence highlighted a pleiotropic potential of CUR towards several human diseases, such as malignancies, skin and immune-related disorders, cardiovascular diseases, pulmonary and renal fibrosis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), fatigue, neuropathic pain, bone and muscle loss, neurodegenerative disease, ocular diseases, leprosy, osteoporosis, leishmaniosis, and HIV infection [52][53][54][55][56][57]. Pleiotropic functions of CUR mainly rely on the inhibition of IκB kinase (IKK) phosphorylation [58] and the consequent suppression of the nuclear translocation of the NF-κB 2 \n\nBioMed Research International p65 subunit [59]. As an alternative epigenetic modulator, CUR also enhances Sirt1 expression at both mRNA and protein levels, ultimately resulting in the suppression of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity and increased NAD + /NADH ratio [60,61]. With the same mechanism, CUR modulated the expression of several types of microRNAs [62][63][64][65]. Through those mechanisms, CUR supplementation in human melanoma cells induces growth arrest in the G2/M phase and then apoptosis [66]. Other studies also reported that CUR may target oncogene expression, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastatic dissemination [67,68] by interfering with several other intracellular pathways including hypoxia-inducible factor-1 α (HIF-1 α), mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1 (MST1), enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor binding, Wnt/β-catenin, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), Sonic Hedgehog, Notch, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) cascade [69][70][71]. Alongside with antitumorigenic activity, CUR was also shown to induce antimicrobial, antioxidant, antiglycemic, antiseptic, and analgesic effects [72][73][74]. This \"pleiotropic\" potential may be ascribed to the potent metal-chelating effects of CUR, which include the scavenging of the superoxide anion, hydroxyl radical, singlet oxygen, and nitrogen dioxide [75,76]. In line with this, other studies demonstrated that CUR may reduce levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyls, thiols, and nitrotyrosines. With regard to inflammation, CUR stimulates a xenobiotic response with upregulation of defense genes (e.g., phase II enzymes and hemeoxygenase-1 [HO-1]) [77] and suppression of proinflammatory transcription factors (e.g., activator protein-1 [AP1]) and cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 [MCP-1]), signal transducer activator of transcription (STAT), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ), activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), and the inducible inflammatory enzymes cyclooxygenase-(COX-) 2 and metalloproteinases [78]. Finally, as observed in human skin fibroblasts, CUR may activate cellular stress response by interacting with the thioldisulfide redox system. Such stress determines a rise in cellular GSH amounts via HO-1 and nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (NRF2) signaling [79], ultimately improving cellular antioxidant defenses [80,81]. Moreover, several studies indicated that CUR and may be used as senolytic and anti-inflammatory agents for senescent cells [82,83]. For instance, a CUR analog, EF24, promoted senescent cell apoptosis and showed protection effect against ionizing-stimulated senescent cells [83]. \n\nEffect of Curcumin on Aging/Longevity\n\n4.1. Vascular Aging. Further enhancing a wide spectrum of activity, growing evidence indicates CUR as a promising antiaging agent (Table 1; Figure 1) [84,85]. The effects of CUR feeding have been largely investigated in animal models, unanimously reporting a suppression of intermediated oxidative stress (e.g., lipoxygenases [LPO], MDA, lipofuscin granules, and NO) and inflammation [3,86]. By chelating nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), CUR administration in mice significantly attenuates nitric oxide-(NO-) associated vascular endothelial dysfunction and generation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs), leading determinants of age-related large elastic artery stiffening [87]. As an additional mechanism, CUR fixes lysosomal membranes and reduces the function of lysosomal acid hydrolases, thus preventing the aberrant deposition of different connective tissue components in aging endothelium. A similar upgrade in endothelial function was also observed in postmenopausal women after eight weeks of treatment [88], whereas in elderly with diabetes and cardiomyopathy, CUR mitigated hypertrophy in the aging heart via suppression of p300, the global transcription activator [89]. Beneficial effects of CUR on vascular aging also concern the development of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), one of the most important causes of blindness in elderly [90,91]. CUR remarkably increases the viability of retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPECs) modulating their proliferation apoptosis and OS [92]. Overall, those evidences suggest potential application of CUR as an innovative approach to AMD, as for other ocular diseases (e.g., ocular dryness, conjunctivitis, uveitis, pterygium, and glaucoma) [93]. Even CUR has been found to prevent the development of cataract in diabetic rats by decreasing AGE accumulation and serum LPO [94,95]. Aging-associated cerebrovascular endothelial dysfunction with consequent chronic cerebral ischemia also plays a critical role in stroke, as well as in cerebral amyloid angiopathy, cognitive impairments, and neurodegenerative disorders [96][97][98]. One of the main pathological mechanisms behind this effect is the generation of ROS, due to the suppression of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) [99] and the downregulation of AMPK. CUR reverses those effects in cultured ECs, whereas in experimental models, prolonged CUR feeding decreased ROS generation and promoted cerebrovascular endotheliumdependent relaxation, finally leading to improved cerebrovascular function [100][101][102][103]. Neuroprotective effects of CUR due to UCP2 overexpression suppression especially target hippocampal neurogenesis in the CA1 area, thus affecting spatial learning and memory. CUR also prevents detrimental effects of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion by maintaining cholesterol homeostasis. CUR also contributes to maintain cholesterol homeostasis, otherwise upset by chronic cerebral ischemia. Indeed, CUR promotes cholesterol efflux through the ATPbinding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and the pathway involving apoA-I and the liver X receptor (LXR)/retinoic X receptor (RXR) [104]. \n\nCognitive Impairments.\n\nWith similar mechanisms, the reduction of circulating antioxidants is tightly associated with memory loss and cognitive impairment in the elderly [105]. It is then not surprising that CUR has been reported to improve neuropsychological functions. CUR has several inhibitory effects on combining aging and Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology, such as the suppression of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Aβ synthesis and the overexpression of ApoE and Nrf2 gene, as well as the prohibition of p-mTOR and p-NF-κB [106,107]. CUR prevents D-gal-induced brain aging and cognitive impairment through increments of antioxidant enzymes and inhibition of apoptosis [108]. Beneficial effects of CUR on mental abilities and functional capacities are associated with a LPO reduction in brain tissue [109], especially in  Curcumin (50 mg/kg) (i) SAMP8 mice (i) Narrowing the hippocampal SOD activities (ii) Elevation of the amount of p-CaMKII in the stratum lucidum of hippocampal CA3 and p-NMDAR1 in the hippocampal membrane [156] Curcumin (0 to 500 mM) (i) Two strains of Drosophila (Canton-S and Ives flies) (i) Protection against oxidative stress (ii) Improvement in locomotion (iii) Modulating the expression of different aging-associated genes, including mth, Thor, InR, and JNK [139] Curcumin (0 to 200 mM) (i) Normal-lived Ra strain (Drosophila) (i) Induction of an extended longevity phenotype (ii) Slowing the aging rate (iii) Increases the adult animal's geotactic activity [144] Curcumin (0.5 to 1.0 mg/g of diet) 5 BioMed Research International the hippocampal area. CUR improves the redox state in this area and prevents the decline of hippocampal long-term potentiation by maintaining synapse input specificity [110,111]. Recently, Olesen et al. described that the dysfunction of synaptic mitochondria of the hippocampus causing memory loss during aging. They showed that curcumin feeding significantly improved integration and activity of the synaptic mitochondrial of the hippocampus, inhibiting mitochondrial swelling and enhancing the production of synapses surrounding the mitochondria in mice [112]. \n\nEvidence from Experimental Models\n\nStudy of Longevity in Drosophila melanogaster and\n\nCaenorhabditis elegans. Drosophila melanogaster (D. melanogaster) and Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) are widely recognized models for the study of aging processes [113]. In particular, D. melanogaster represented a paradigm of experimental gerontology during the last century [114][115][116][117][118] because of its complex biology and the ease of rearing and housing as well [119,120]. More recently, in 1983, Klass isolated the first long-lived mutants of C. elegans [121], which rose to become a promising model for aging investigations due to the small size, anatomical simplicity, small genome, short life cycle, and inexpensive laboratory manipulation [122]. In C. elegans, longevity is widely determined by the expression of the Age-1 gene [123,124]. As one of the main elements in the insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling (IIS) axis, Age-1 is a subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), which suppresses DAF-16 action [123][124][125]. Suppression of the IIS pathway activates the downstream gene DAF-16, which in turn promotes the transcription of genes associated with longevity, metabolism, and response to cellular stress [126][127][128]. In line, increased lifespan may also be obtained through TOR inhibition, another DAF-16 suppressor [129,130]. By sharing the same downstream signaling of DAF-16, also the FOXO3 A gene is involved in lifespan extension, cell growth, and stress response through a direct  although curcumin induced eNOS, NO, Sirt1, HO-1, and UCP2 expression. Curcumin also mitigates the SASP and its aging-induction consequences of senescent cell. Abbreviations: Aβ: amyloid-β; eNOS: endothelial nitric-oxide synthase; HO-1: hemeoxygenase-1; mTORC 1: mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1; NO: nitric oxide; ROS: reactive oxygen species; SASP: senescenceassociated secretory phenotype; Sirt: sirtuins; UCP2: uncoupling protein 2. \n\n6\n\nBioMed Research International activity on DNA repair and transcription involving p21/p53 and β-catenin pathways [131][132][133]. Noteworthy, FOXO has a multistep regulation involving not only IGF-1 but also NAD+/Sirt1, 5 ′ AMPK, and OS, all known as aging genes [134]. Due to these similarity with human beings, C. elegans became a genetic model organism already in 1965. Multiple pharmacological interventions have been found to prolong the survival of D. melanogaster and C. elegans [135][136][137]. Also, CUR was shown to increase the fecundity, reproductive lifespan, and child viability of D. melanogaster [85]. It has been shown that CUR supplementation at the larval stage of D. melanogaster elevated the developmental duration and longevity of adult Drosophila possibly through epigenetic programming of the pace of life [138]. CUR-mediated increased longevity was observed in two distinctive strains of D. melanogaster (Canton-S and Ivies flies) as a result of the delayed expression of aging genes (e.g., methuselah (mth), thor, insulin receptor [InR], and cjun N-terminal kinase [JNK]), improved locomotion, and chemoprevention as well [139]. CUR was also shown to reduce OS, DNA damage, and number of mutagenic phenotypes induced via high-dose ionizing irradiation. These effects may be ascribed to ROS scavenging and transcriptional regulation of OS-related genes, which mainly involves γH2Ax, a histone protein belonging to the H2A family and involved in DNA damage response [140][141][142]. Also, in vivo experiments on CUR-fed diets (0.5 and 1.0 mg/g of diet) were effective in extending the average lifespan in both females (6.2% and 25.8%, respectively) and males (15.5% and 12.6%, respectively), and this effect could be more likely attributed to the overexpression of Mn-SOD and CuZn-SOD genes and the downregulation of aging genes associated with the TOR pathway including Drosophila insulin receptor (dInR), attacin-D (ATTD), defensin (Def), cecropin B (CecB), and diptericin B (DptB) genes [143,144]. Also, in C. elegans, CUR effectively improves lifespan and aging by lowering intracellular ROS and lipofuscin. The effects of CUR on C. elegans longevity are manifested by body size and pharyngeal pumping rate but not reproduction ability. Further studies revealed that the long-lived phenotype induced by CUR was maintained in mev-1 and daf-16 mutants but lost in osr-1, sek-1, skn-1, unc-43, mek-1, sir-2.1, and age-1 ones [145]. This evidence indicates that CUR would exert its effects independently of the Age-1-DAF-16 pathway but rather through other constituents of the IIS pathway. With regard to cognitive impairment, the in vivo experiment demonstrated that CUR can improve learning and memory also reducing Aβ plaque formation in the context of Alzheimer disease (AD) [146]. D. melanogaster is a promising animal model for research in AD [147]. By increasing amyloid fibril conversion, CUR reduces the generation of prefibrillar/oligomeric species of Aβ, ultimately protecting against neurotoxicity [148]. The human β-amyloid precursor cleavage enzyme (BACE-1) is another critical enzyme targeted by CUR [149,150] in the D. melanogaster model of AD [150]. \n\nStudies of Cell Senescence: Evidence from Mice and\n\nRats. High doses of CUR (2.5-10 μM) were shown to trigger senescence in cancer and vascular cells [151]. On the other hand, low doses of CUR (0.1 and 1 μM) failed to prevent early senescence in doxorubicin-treated (VSMC) and even slightly accelerated replicative senescence in endothelial cells [152]. It is therefore evident how the antiaging effect of CUR does not rely on delayed cellular senescence. As reported by Banji et al., CUR (40 mg/kg) and piperine (12 mg/kg), especially when combined, counteract D-gal-induced senescence in male Wistar rats by targeting OS and lipofuscin deposition, finally leading to higher hippocampal volume and function with improved spatial memory and serotoninergic signaling [153]. Another study even reported how long-time CUR therapy may progressively reverse cognitive dysfunction in D-galinduced senescent mice by delaying the aging process and improving cognitive functions and locomotor activity, as well as restoring the mitochondrial enzyme complex function [154]. In a recent study, CUR supplementation rejuvenates senescence-associated changes in thymus among D-galinduced senescent mice through promotion of proliferating cells, preventing cells from apoptosis, and enhancing the transcription of the autoimmune regulator (Aire) [155]. \n\nCUR feeding (50 mg/kg) was also tested in senescenceaccelerated mouse prone (SAMP) mice resulting in increased hippocampal SOD activity as well as upregulation of p-calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (p-CaMKII) in the stratum lucidum and p-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit 1 (p-NMDAR1) in the hippocampal membrane [156]. Noteworthy, clinical benefits of the CUR analogue PE859 have been recently reported and associated with reduction of Aβ and tau aggregates in the mouse brain [157,158]. Overall, these findings suggest a role of CUR in improving cognitive difficulties and the expression of hippocampal plasticity-associated proteins. With regard to vascular function, CUR administration significantly mitigated premature senescence in HUVECs, characterized by a reduction of senescence-related β-galactosidase-positive cells, cell division, levels of senescence-related protein p21 RNA, OS, and apoptosis. CUR is also associated with enhanced eNOS phosphorylation and NO generation, in addition to upregulating Sirt1 transcription, translation, and enzymatic activity [159]. In light of these mechanisms, dietscontaining tetrahydrocurcumin (THC), the main metabolite of CUR, were demonstrated to significantly extend mean lifespan in male C57BL/6 mice [160], whereas bisdemethoxycurcumin administration delayed the OS-caused premature senescence via Sirt1/AMPK cascade activation [161]. As recently demonstrated, Sirt1 signaling also mediates the antiinflammatory effects of CUR in C57BL/6 mice fed with high fat diet [162] in addition to improved myocardial structure and function in streptozocin-induced diabetic mice fed with THC (120 mg/kg/d) [163]. Even more recently, it has been hypothesized that the antiaging effect of CUR may rely on the control of core clock genes on which Sirt1 belongs alongside rBmal1, rCry1, rCry2, rPer1, rPer2, and rRev-erba. CUR treatment in middle aged male Wistar rats restored the phase and daily pulse of rCry1, rCry2, rPer1, and rPer2 as in the young, whereas only rPer1 and partly rBmal1, rCry1, and rCry2 were restored in the old ones [164]. Moreover, it has been shown that CUR mitigated mouse ovarian aging, upgraded embryonic development, promoted oocyte maturation and fertilization via improvement of ovarian hormones, 7 BioMed Research International and elevated the amounts of SIRT1 and 3 genes as well as attenuation of aging-associated oxidative stress and cell death [165]. Besides, CUR can reduce oxidative stress, inflammation status, and lipofuscin deposition in aged rat liver [166]. \n\nConclusion\n\nAging and senescence are complex processes leading to organ dysfunction. Despite being permanent, delaying the occurrence of these processes is a reliable target, and CUR might be a promising candidate for this purpose. Nevertheless, evidence from clinical studies on the long-term effects of CUR on age-related pathological events remains largely understudied. While several strategies to enhance the systemic bioavailability of CUR have been suggested, the effects of long-term therapy with such bioavailability-boosted CUR preparations is not fully known, and increased concentrations may even lead to opposite results. Pleiotropic benefits of CUR supplementation involve the control of aging genes, OS, and inflammation in both the vascular system and the central nervous system. Further studies are warranted to clarify the mechanisms of CUR function for potential clinical application. \n\nAbbreviations\n\nAβ: \n\nAmyloid-β AGEs: \n\nAdvanced glycation end-products ATTD:

Winkler"], "body": {"text": "\nIntroduction\n\nTaxis-type migration processes have been identified as impellent mechanisms of crucial importance for the emergence of multifarious dynamics in numerous biological systems at various levels of complexity. Especially the destabilizing potential of attractive chemotaxis, and its responsibility for striking experimental findings, e.g. on paradigmatic bacterial aggregation phenomena but also on self-organization in more intricate frameworks, has received considerable interest ( [17], [14]). Accordingly, a meanwhile abundant mathematical literature has been focusing on issues related to the ability of such taxis mechanisms to enforce the formation of structures, not only in contexts of simple paradigmatic Keller-Segel type chemotaxis models ( [13], [6], [23], [24], [34]) but also in some more general triangular cross-diffusion systems embedding taxis processes into more complex settings ( [19], [28], [11], [35], [30]).\n\nIn comparison to this, the knowledge seems much less developed in cases in which several taxis mechanisms are mutually coupled. A prototypical situation of this type is addressed in [32], where systems of the form\n\nare proposed as refinements of classical reaction-diffusion models for predator-prey interaction, supplemented by attractive taxis of predators toward regions of increasing prey population densities, and by repulsive cross-diffusive migration of prey individuals downward population gradients of the predators (cf. also [37], [36], [33], [16] and [18] for further modeling aspects related to predator-taxis and prey-taxis). As documented in [32] and [33], formal linear analysis indicates that the indeed introduction of such taxis mechanisms enables pursuit-evasion systems of the form (1.1) to exhibit quite colorful wave-like solution behavior. From a perspective of rigorous analysis, however, passing on to such fully cross-diffusive systems, in which hence the collection of migration mechanisms can no longer be arranged in the form of a triangular diffusion operator, apparently amounts to entering quite uncharted territories. In fact, studies on cross-diffusion systems involving fully occupied diffusion matrices seem to essentially concentrate on systems of Shigesada-Kawasaki-Teramoto type, for which indeed a considerably comprehensive theory at least with regard to questions of global solvability, but partially even going beyond, could be developed ( [7], [8], [9], [10], [21], [29], [22]). However, since the migration mechanisms therein do not only exhibit structures evidently different from those in (1.1), but since they moreover, and yet more drastically, are exclusively of repulsive character, such model classes can only be viewed as far relatives of (1.1), with hence quite limited potential for accessibility to similar techniques. Accordingly, the analytical literature concerned with a doubly tactic system of type (1.1) apparently reduces to the single precedent [31], in which a method is designed that in the absence of sources, that is, in the case when f = g = 0, can be used to establish results on global existence and stabilization toward spatial averages in a corresponding one-dimensional boundary value poblem.\n\nObjectives and challenges. The intention of this work is to address a system of type (1.1) in a more realistic setting of predator-prey evolution in which doubly tactic pursuit-evasion interplay is coupled to appropriate kinetics. Concentrating on classical Lotka-Volterra interaction as a paradigmatic framework therefor, we shall henceforth consider the apparently prototypical version of a fully cross-diffusive predator-prey system given by (1.2) in an open bounded interval as the spatial domain, where for i ∈ {1, 2} the parameters D i , a i , λ i and χ i are positive.\n\nOur particular purpose consists firstly in establishing a result on global existence of solutions within a natural weak framework, and secondly in attempting to undertake a basic step toward understanding qualitative effects of the doubly cross-diffusive mechanisms in (1.2) when accompanied by zero-order predator-prey interaction. Indeed, standard results on local existence of smooth solutions to Keller-Segel-type systems accounting for cross-diffusion exclusively in one quantity ( [15], [2]) confirm that the diffusion-induced relaxing behavior known from the situation when χ 1 = χ 2 = 0 persists at least during suitably small initial time intervals when χ 1 = 0 as long as χ 2 yet vanishes. On the other hand, the simultaneous appearance of taxis-type cross-diffusion in both equations from (1.2) may quite drastically affect this picture in that when both taxis mechanisms are attractive in the sense that χ 1 > 0 > χ 2 , then in general not even local solutions can be expected to exist, even in the case when the kinetic terms therein are completely disregarded and the initial data belong to (C ∞ (Ω)) 2 ( [31]).\n\nAs already suggested by the outcome of the precedent work [31], such an instantaneously and thoroughly destabilizing role may not be played by doubly taxis-like interaction in cases when only one of the cross-diffusive migration processes is attractive, with the other one being repulsive. In particular, addressing the simplified variant of (1.2) given by\n\nwith χ 1 and χ 2 both assumed positive, the main results in [31] assert that in an open bounded domain Ω ⊂ R and for all reasonably regular nonnegative initial data, a corresponding Neumanntype initial-boundary value problem possesses a globally defined nonnegative weak solution, inter alia belonging to the space (L ∞ ((0, ∞); L log L(Ω))) 2 . Moreover, this solution is shown to become bounded in the pointwise sense at least eventually, and that both of its components uniformly approach their respective temporally constant spatial mean in the large time limit. This inter alia indicates that the pattern-supporting potential of the attractive taxis mechanism therein, well-known e.g. as generating nonconstant steady states in associated Keller-Segel systems ( [26], [20]), is insufficient to enforce any structure formation on large time scales when accompanied by repulsion as in (1.3).\n\nAs a fundamental technical obstacle, any analytical approach to questions concerning solvability in (1.2) needs to face the circumstance that no general theory seems available which might at least warrant local existence of some solutions. Hence forced to construct solutions either from a very basic starting point e.g. within a suitable fixed point framework, or via approximation, in this work we choose the latter type of ansatz by means of a fourth-order regularization reminiscent of the well-studied thin film equation ( [5], [3], [12], [25]). Indeed, we shall see that when carefully designed, beyond providing accessibility to well-established local solution theory ( [1]), this approach will in quite a natural manner bring about the important advantage of paving the way for a qualitative analysis through the derivation of a priori estimates at the level of approximate solutions, and might thereby turn out to be more appropriate than e.g. discretization-based methods ( [7], [8], [9]) which in the present context, beyond apparently unsolved problems already at the stage of solvability, seem to offer somewhat less flexibility with regard to testing procedures.\n\nThin-film-type approximation. To make our concrete strategy more precise, let us first specify the full setting in which (1.2) will be studied, and subsequently consider (1.4) in an open bounded interval Ω ⊂ R, where the initial data u 0 and v 0 , along with approximating families (u 0ε ) ε∈(0,1) and (v 0ε ) ε∈(0,1) , will be assumed to be such that\n\non ∂Ω for all ε ∈ (0, 1) and 1 2 inf Ω u 0 ≤ u 0ε ≤ u 0 + 1 in Ω and Ω u 2 0εx ≤ Ω u 2 0x + 1 for all ε ∈ (0, 1), that\n\n≤ Ω v 2 0x + 1 for all ε ∈ (0, 1), and that u 0ε → u 0 and v 0ε → v 0 a.e. in Ω as ε ց 0.\n\n(1.5)\n\nWe henceforth fix any α ∈ (0, 1 2 ], and with free parameters n 1 > 0 and n 2 > 0 to be specified below we consider the regularized parabolic system\n\nx ∈ Ω, t > 0, (1.6) along with homogeneous Neumann-type boundary data and under the initial conditions given by\n\nfor ε ∈ (0, 1). An introduction both of similar thin-film-type fourth-order diffusion operators and of corresponding second-order fast diffusion corrections has already been underlying the analysis in [31]; a difference of crucial importance in the present approach, however, consists in the circumstance that the parameters n 1 and n 2 , which may be viewed as measuring a certain intermediate-scale degeneracy of the considered fourth-order diffusion mechanisms, will be allowed to attain different values here: While the development of our existence theory will merely require that n i ∈ [1,2] for i ∈ {1, 2}, our subsequent qualitative analysis will rely on the specific choices (n 1 , n 2 ) = (2, 2) and (n 1 , n 2 ) = (2, 1), respectively, depending on the parameter setting dictated by the Lotka-Volterra interaction in (1.4).\n\nMain results.\n\nIn fact, we shall firstly see that if we restrict n 1 and n 2 so as to satisfy n i ∈ [1, 2] for i ∈ {1, 2}, then the artificial terms introduced herein conveniently cooperate with a quasi-entropy property formally enjoyed by the functional\n\nwhen evaluated along suitably smooth trajectories of (1.4). This notice, generalizing an observation already made in the context of a slightly different regularization for (1.3) in [31], will lead us to the first of our main results, by asserting global solvability without any restrictions on the system parameters in (1.4), and for widely arbitrary initial data:\n\n, 2} let the constants D i , a i , λ i and χ i be positive, and suppose that u 0 ∈ W 1,2 (Ω) and v 0 ∈ W 1,2 (Ω) are such that u 0 > 0 and v 0 > 0 in Ω.\n\nThen there exist nonnegative functions u and v defined a.e. in Ω × (0, ∞) and satisfying\n\n(1.9) which are such that (u, v) forms a global weak solution of (1.4) in the sense of Definition 4.1 below. This solution can be obtained as the limit of solutions to (1.6)-(1.7) in that whenever n 1 ∈ [1, 2], n 2 ∈ [1, 2] and α ∈ (0, 1 2 ] and (u 0ε ) ε∈(0,1) and (v 0ε ) ε∈(0,1) satisfy (1.5), there exists (ε j ) j∈N ⊂ (0, 1) such that ε j ց 0 as j → ∞, and that u ε → u as well as v ε → v a.e. in Ω × (0, ∞) as ε = ε j ց 0.\n\n(1.10)\n\nBeyond establishing the above existence result which with regard to its outcome essentially parallels Theorem 1.1 in [31], our analysis related to (1.8) will moreover be organized in such a way that a beneficent dependence of correspondingly gained estimates on the sensitivities χ 1 and χ 2 can be cropped out. Together with a rather straightforward observation identifying a (χ 1 , χ 2 )-independent absorbing set in (L 1 (Ω)) 2 for (1.6)-(1.7) (Lemma 2.3), the regularity information thus provided by a quasi-entropy inequality associated with (1.8) will imply eventual bounds for solutions to (1.6)-(1.7) in somewhat stronger topologies, independent of the initial data and depending on χ 1 and χ 2 in a favorably controllable manner (Lemma 5.4). In a key step to be achieved in Lemma 6.2, these ultimate bounds will further be improved so as to become manifest even in (W 1,2 (Ω)) 2 , provided that χ 1 and χ 2 satisfy a smallness condition which, importantly, involves essentially no knowledge on the initial data.\n\nThis will bear fruit by implying global asymptotic stability of the nontrivial spatially homogeneous steady states of (1.4), in the case λ 2 > a 2 λ 1 given by (u ⋆ , v ⋆ ) with u ⋆ := λ 1 + a 1 λ 2 1 + a 1 a 2 and v ⋆ := λ 2 − a 2 λ 1 1 + a 1 a 2 (1.11) and by (λ 1 , 0) if λ 2 ≤ a 2 λ 1 , whenever χ 1 and χ 2 are suitably small: In Section 8 addressing the former case, we shall see that then for small χ 1 and χ 2 and any choice of initial data compatible with (1.5),\n\neventually plays the role of a genuine entropy functional for (1.6)-(1.7), up to a regularization error, under a crucial additional assumption on structural consistency of our approximation, here expressed in the hypothesis that n 1 = n 2 = 2 which is fortunately in compliance with Theorem 1.1 (Lemma 8.3).\n\nIn conjunction with the compactness properties of trajectories entailed by Lemma 6.2, this further dissipative structure will lead us to the following second of our main results:\n\none can find χ ⋆⋆ > 0 such that if χ 1 ∈ (0, χ ⋆⋆ ) and χ 2 ∈ (0, χ ⋆⋆ ) as well as n 1 = 2 and n 2 = 2, then for any choice of initial data fulfilling (1.5) the global weak solution (u, v) of (1.4) from Theorem 1.1 has the properties that\n\nfor some T > 0, (1.13) and that as t → ∞,\n\nwhere u ⋆ > 0 and v ⋆ > 0 are as in (1.11).\n\nIn the opposite parameter range where λ 2 ≤ a 2 λ 1 , an accordingly modified analysis identifying a corresponding entropy property of a functional approximating\n\nwill finally reveal in Section 9 the following analogue of the above statement under the assumption that yet n 1 = 2 but that now n 2 satisfies the alternative consistency condition n 2 = 1, both still admissible in Theorem 1.1: \n\nBasic properties of the approximate problems\n\nTo begin with, we recall that Amann's theory provides a basic statement on local existence and extensibility of solutions to (1.6)-(1.7) in the following sense.\n\nand n i ∈ (0, 4), and assume (1.5). The for all ε ∈ (0, 1) and any t ∈ (0, T max,ε ),\n\nProof. We multiply the first equation in (1.6) by −u εxx and integrate by parts to see that\n\nwhere another integration by parts, followed by an application of Lemma 2.4, shows that\n\nbecause α(α+1) 3 · 9 (α+1) 2 = 3α α+1 ≤ 1 thanks to our assumption that α ≤ 1 2 . Apart from that, observing that for all ε ∈ (0, 1) and any s ≥ 0 we have d ds\n\nand d ds\n\nin the rightmost expression in (2.12) we may once more rely on integration by parts to estimate\n\nfor all t ∈ (0, T max,ε ). (2.14)\n\nAs finally\n\nby Young's inequality, in view of (2.13) and (2.14) we readily infer (2.10) from (2.12). The inequality (2.11) can be derived similarly.\n\nUnder the additional requirements that 1 ≤ n 1 ≤ 2 and 1 ≤ n 2 ≤ 2, for each fixed ε ∈ (0, 1) the integrals in (2.10) and (2.11) originating from the cross-diffusive interaction in (1.6) can conveniently be estimated in terms of the respective higher-order dissipative contributions, thus leading to the following ε-dependent bound with respect to the norm in W 1,2 (Ω).\n\n, 2}, and let (1.5) be valid. Then for all ε ∈ (0, 1) and T > 0 there exists C(ε, T ) > 0 such that\n\nwhere T ε := min{T, T max,ε }.\n\nProof.\n\nIn the cross-diffusive term on the right of (2.10), we integrate by parts and use Young's inequality to find that for all t ∈ (0, T max,ε ),\n\nwhere since 1 ≤ n 1 ≤ 2, again due to Young's inequality we obtain that\n\nHere we use that\n\nby Lemma 2.3, which in conjunction with the Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality and Young's inequality shows that (2.18) implies that with some c 1 > 0 and c 2 > 0 we have\n\nAlso the last summand in (2.10) can be controlled by means of Young's inequality and the Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality, which thanks to (2.19) namely provide c 3 > 0 and c 4 > 0 fulfilling\n\nCombined with (2.17) and (2.20), this shows that (2.10) entails the inequality\n\nso that applying quite a similar procedure to (2.11) we infer the existence of c 5 > 0 such that\n\nwhich upon integration yields (2.15) and thereby also implies (2.16) due to the continuity of the embedding W 1,2 (Ω) ֒→ L ∞ (Ω).\n\nThe following conclusion of Lemma 2.6 parallels that of Lemma 2.3 from [31] in its statement, but its derivation proceeds in a slightly different manner.\n\nLemma 2.7 Let D i > 0, a i > 0, λ i > 0, χ i > 0 and n i ∈ [1, 2] for i ∈ {1, 2}, and assume (1.5). Then given any ε ∈ (0, 1), for all T > 0 one can find C(ε, T ) > 0 such that again writing T ε := min{T, T max,ε } we have\n\nProof. On the basis of (1.6)-(1.7) and several integrations by parts, we compute\n\nfor all t ∈ (0, T max,ε ), (2.22) where one more integration by parts, followed by an application of Young's inequality, shows that for all t ∈ (0, T max,ε ),\n\nIn order to estimate the rightmost summand herein appropriately, we recall that according to Lemma 2.6 there exist\n\nThe latter, namely ensures that\n\nby nonnegativity of u ε . Since the Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality provides c 3 > 0 such that\n\nalong with (2.24) this enables us to invoke Young's inequality in making sure that\n\n4−n 1 . Next, in the second last summand in (2.22) we use Young's inequality to see that again thanks to (2.24),\n\nFinally, in the last integral in (2.22) we may use (2.25) to achieve the rough estimate\n\nIn combination with (2.23), (2.26), (2.28) and (2.29), this shows that (2.22) entails the inequality\n\nand thereby yields the claimed estimate for u ε , while that for v ε can be derived similarly.\n\nAs well-known from [31], the estimates from 2.6 and Lemma 2.7 in combination yield pointwise lower bounds for both solution components:\n\n, 2}, and let (1.5) hold. Then for all ε ∈ (0, 1) and T > 0 there exists C(ε, T ) > 0 such that\n\nwhere again T ε := min{T, T max,ε }.\n\nProof.\n\nBased on Lemma 2.6 with Lemma 2.7, this can be obtained by verbatim copying the argument from [31,Lemma 2.4].\n\nAgain referring to a corresponding argument from [31], we may refrain from giving details concerning the derivation of H 2 estimates of the following flavor.\n\n, 2}, and let (1.5) hold. Then for all ε ∈ (0, 1) and T > 0 one can find C(ε, T ) > 0 fulfilling\n\nwhere again T ε := min{T, T max,ε }.\n\nProof. This estimate can be derived by testing the first two equations in (1.6) against u εxxxx and v εxxxx and estimating all appearing ill-signed lower-order integrals in terms of the respective fourthorder dissipative summands, using thanks to Lemma 2.8 and Lemma 2.6 the latter are bounded from below by suitable positive multiples of Ω u 2 εxxxx and Ω v 2 εxxxx . For a corresponding argument in a specialized setting without the kinetic terms from (1.6) we refer to [31, Lemma 2.5], and we may omit detailing the minor adaptations necessary in the present framework.\n\nIn view of (2.1), collecting our ε-dependent regularity information we can now make sure that indeed all our approximate solutions actually exist globally in time.\n\nProof. This directly results from a combination of Lemma 2.9, Lemma 2.8, Lemma 2.3 and (2.1).\n\n3 A quasi-entropy structure reminiscent of (1.8)\n\nWe next intend to analyze a regularization-adapted modification of the functional in (1.8). Here in contrast to the simplified setup in [31] in which the absence of kinetic terms implies a genuine Lyapunov property, in the present context the appearance of the zero-order terms in (1.6) requires substantial additional efforts. These will be prepared by the following basic observation.\n\nfor all s ≥ 0 and any ε ∈ (0, 1).\n\nProof. In the case ν = 2, (3.1) follows from the simple estimate\n\nfor all s ≥ 0 and any ε ∈ (0, 1).\n\nfor all s > 0, whence ϕ attains its maximum at s 0 :=\n\nwhich verifies (3.1) also in this case.\n\nWe can now make sure that if in addition to the above we assume n 1 ≥ 1 and n 2 ≥ 1, then our approximation in (1.6) indeed cooperates with a fundamental structural property of (1.4) in the following sense.\n\nThen there exists C > 0 such that whenever χ 1 > 0 and χ 2 > 0 and (1.5) holds, for all ε ∈ (0, 1) the functions F ε and D ε defined by\n\nand\n\nand we observe that thus, in particular,\n\nand hence\n\naccording to our assumption that n i ∈ [1,2]. In order to make appropriate use of this, we now go back to (1.6)-(1.7) and integrate by parts in computing\n\nwhere (3.6) and (3.5) directly yield\n\nas well as\n\nand\n\nIn the first summand on the right of (3.9), we integrate by parts two more times to find that thanks to (3.8) and (3.7),\n\nfor all t > 0, (3.14) so that collecting (3.9)-(3.14) we obtain\n\nAs similarly\n\non taking a suitable linear combination of the latter two relations we can achieve a cancellation of the respective cross-diffusive contributions and thereby obtain the inequality\n\nfor all t > 0. Here clearly\n\nfor all t > 0, so that using the estimates ln ξ ≤ 2 ξ for ξ ≥ 1 and\n\nby means of Young's inequality we infer that\n\nSince the Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality provides c 1 > 0 fulfilling\n\nfor all ϕ ∈ W 1,2 (Ω).\n\nby several applications of Young's inequality we can herein estimate\n\nfor all t > 0. Next, noting that again thanks to (3.16),\n\ndue to the inequality −ξ ln ξ ≤ 1 e for ξ ∈ (0, 1]. In the last and the third last summand in (3.15) we make use of Lemma 3.1, which when applied to ν = n 1 entails that\n\nbecause of our restriction that ε < 1. Twice more employing Lemma 3.1, with ν = n 2 and ν = n 2 − 1, respectively, furthermore shows that again due to Young's inequality,\n\nfor all t > 0, where we have once more used that ε < 1, and that n 2 ≥ 1.\n\nIn summary, we only need to insert (3.18) into (3.17), combine the latter with (3.19), (3.20) and (3.21), and to particularly observe the dependence of the obtained estimate on χ 1 and χ 2 exclusively through the factor 1 + χ 1 χ 2 , to infer from (3.15) that indeed (3.4) holds with an appropriate choice of C. In order to prepare appropriate integration of (3.4) for the purpose of deriving estimates essential for our existence proof (Lemma 4.1), but also later in our qualitative analysis (Lemma 5.4), let us note the following relationship between F ε and the nonnegative quantities Ω u ε ln(u ε + e) and Ω v ε ln(v ε + e). Then there exists C > 0 such that given any χ 1 > 0 and χ 2 > 0 and initial data such that (1.5) holds, with F ε as in (3.2) we have Ω u ε (·, t) ln(u ε (·, t) + e) + χ 1\n\nfor all t > 0 and ε ∈ (0, 1). (3.22) Moreover, sup\n\nProof. Again relying on the inequality ξ ln ξ ≥ − 1 e for ξ ∈ (0, e], for all t > 0 and ε ∈ (0, 1) we can estimate\n\nand performing the same operations on v ε we obtain that by (3.2),\n\nfor all t > 0 and ε ∈ (0, 1), which establishes (3.22).\n\nApart from that, since u 0 and v 0 are positive, and since (1.5) requires that u 0ε Before proceeding, let us now sharpen our objective by specifying our solution concept in the following natural sense. will be called a global weak solution of (1.4) if\n\nBased on Lemma 3.2, in this section we shall derive estimates for solutions to (1.6)-(1.7) which allow for an appropriate subsequence extraction process, in the limit yielding a solution in the above sense. As our approach parallels that in [31] in some parts, we may concentrate on the essential and novel aspects here, beyond this restricting ourselves to outlining the main steps.\n\nA first integration of (3.4): Global regularity properties for fixed χ i\n\nUsing the L 1 bounds provided by Lemma 2.3, for arbitrary but fixed cross-diffusion coefficients we obtain the following from a first integration of (3.4) in a straightforward manner, emphasizing that throughout this section all appearing constants may depend on χ 1 and χ 2 . 2], and assume (1.5). Then for all T > 0 there exists C(T ) > 0 such that for any ε ∈ (0, 1),\n\nand that\n\nas well as\n\nProof. We employ Lemma 2.3 to find c 1 > 0 such that\n\nfor all t > 0 and ε ∈ (0, 1), (4.8) and observe that therefore Lemma 3.2 implies that with some c 2 > 0, the functions F ε and D ε in (3.2) and (3.3) satisfy\n\nfor all t > 0 and any ε ∈ (0, 1) and hence, upon integration,\n\nfor all t > 0 and each ε ∈ (0, 1). (4.9)\n\nThus, if in accordance with Lemma 3.3 and (4.8) we pick c 3 > 0 and c 4 > 0 large enough such that\n\nand\n\nfor all t > 0 and ε ∈ (0, 1), then from (4.9) we infer that\n\nfor all t > 0 and ε ∈ (0, 1), from which in view of (3.3) both (4.4) and (4.5) as well as (4.6) and (4.7) directly follow.\n\nFurther consequences can be drawn by means of the following interpolation inequality which can be found in [31,Corollary 7.6].\n\nLemma 4.2 There exists C > 0 such that for all ϕ ∈ W 1,2 (Ω) satisfying ϕ > 0 in Ω,\n\nInter alia by utilizing the latter, from Lemma 4.1 we can derive three more spatio-temporal estimates, the first and the third among which will yield precompactness of the cross-diffusive fluxes from (1.6) in spatio-temporal L 1 spaces, and the second of which will play an important role in our asymptotic analysis by implying positive lower bounds for the mass functionals in Lemma 5.3. \n\nas well as\n\nProof. Given T > 0, we first apply Lemma 4.1 to find c 1 (T ) > 0 and c 2 (T ) > 0 such that\n\nfor all t ∈ (0, T ) and ε ∈ (0, 1) (4.13) and T 0 Ω\n\nfor all ε ∈ (0, 1). (4.14)\n\nAs a consequence of Lemma 4.2, combining these inequality immediately yields (4.10).\n\nSince by the Hölder inequality,\n\nfor all ε ∈ (0, 1), using that ln(u ε + e) ≥ 1 and arguing similarly for v ε we thereafter obtain (4.12) from (4.10) and (4.14). Finally, as the Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality provides c 3 > 0 fulfilling\n\nfor all ϕ ∈ W 1,2 (Ω), once more combining (4.13) with (4.14) we infer that\n\nand thereby conclude that also (4.11) holds.\n\nA last preparation for our limit procedure asserts ε-independent estimates for the time derivatives of u ε and v ε with respect to the norm in some suitably large spaces. Beyond this, these bounds will later on once more be recalled in the course of our qualitative analysis (cf. Corollary 6.3).\n\n, 2}, and assume (1.5). Then for all T > 0 one can find C(T ) > 0 such that\n\nProof. This can be obtained by minor modification of the reasoning in [31,Lemma 3.4].\n\nCollecting the above, we arrive at the following.\n\n, 2}, and assume (1.5). Then one can find (ε j ) j∈N ⊂ (0, 1) and nonnegative functions u and v defined in Ω × (0, ∞) such that (1.9) holds, that ε j ց 0 as j → ∞, and that with some null set N ⊂ (0, ∞) we have \n\nEventual bounds I. A second integration of (3.4)\n\nNext addressing the large time behavior of the solutions gained above in the case when χ 1 and χ 2 are suitably small, since in view of Theorem 1.2 and Theorem 1.3 we intend to admit initial data of arbitrary size our first step will consist in making sure that any such solution can eventually be controlled by quantities independent of the initial data, similarly to the second conclusion from Lemma 2.3 but in more useful topological frameworks.\n\nFor this purpose, we shall once more return to the quasi-entropy inequality from Lemma 3.2, but now with the ambition to make more efficient use of the dissipation rate appearing therein. Here an obstacle toward straightforward approches seems to be linked to the observation that according to (3.2), for each fixed ε ∈ (0, 1) the functional F ε contains summands proportional to the integrals An elementary but important interpolation lemma, formulated in a way general enough to allow for two further applications later in Lemma 8.4 and Lemma 9.3, will be of decisive support in overcoming this difficulty:\n\nii) The inequality\n\nholds.\n\nProof. i) We fix x 0 ∈ Ω such that ϕ(x 0 ) ≥ 1 |Ω| Ω ϕ and then use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to see that for all x ∈ Ω,\n\nThanks to Young's inequality, this implies that\n\nfor all x ∈ Ω and thus establishes (5.1) upon integration.\n\nii) Likewise,\n\n, which after integration results in (5.2).\n\nIndeed, an application of the first part thereof enables us to create an absorptive linear summand in (3.4) at the expense of additional expressions on its right-hand side, which however remain under control as long as the mass functionals Ω u ε and Ω v ε remain uniformly positive:\n\n, 2}, one can find C > 0 such that if χ 1 > 0 and χ 2 > 0 and (1.5) holds, then for all ε ∈ (0, 1) the functions F ε and D ε from (3.2) and (3.3) have the property that\n\nfor all t > 0.\n\nProof. In view of Lemma 3.2 and Young's inequality, it is clearly sufficient to make sure that given D 1 > 0, D 2 > 0, a 1 > 0, a 2 > 0, λ 1 > 0 and λ 2 > 0, one can find c 1 > 0 such that whenever χ 1 > 0 and χ 2 > 0 and (1.5) holds, then for any ε ∈ (0, 1) we have\n\nfor all t > 0. To achieve this, we note that e.g. by once more combining the Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality with Youngs inequality in a straightforward manner we can find positive constants c 2 and c 3 such that for all ϕ ∈ C 1 (Ω) fulfilling ϕ > 0 in Ω we have\n\nTherefore,\n\nfor all t > 0, (5.5) where the two rightmost summands can be estimated by means of Lemma 5.1 i), which when applied to p = q = 3 − n i , i ∈ {1, 2}, says that for all t > 0,\n\nand\n\n.\n\nIn conjunction with (5.5) and the definition (3.3) of D ε , these inequalities readily establish (5.3) with some suitably large C > 0.\n\nAs a natural next task, we are thus concerned with positive lower bounds for Ω u ε and Ω v ε . Thanks to the second estimate provided by Corollary 4.3, however, at least within time intervals of finite length these can be obtained by simply returning to (1.6)-(1.7):\n\n, 2}, and suppose that (1.5) holds. Then for all T > 0 there exists C(T ) > 0 such that whenever ε ∈ (0, 1),\n\nfor all t ∈ (0, T ). Thus, if going back to (1.6)-(1.7) we estimate\n\nu ε for all t > 0 and ε ∈ (0, 1), then upon integration we infer that thanks to (5.7),\n\nfor all t ∈ (0, T ) and ε ∈ (0, 1), with c 2 := inf ε∈(0,1) Ω u 0ε being positive due to (1.5) and the positivity of u 0 . Likewise, from the inequality\n\nΩ v ε for all t > 0 and ε ∈ (0, 1),\n\nfor all t ∈ (0, T ) and any ε ∈ (0, 1)\n\nMaking use of the fact that the singular expressions on the right-hand side of (5.3) contain the small factor ε, on integration thereof we infer the following data-independent eventual regularity information as the main outcome of this section. \n\nProof. By means of Lemma 5.2 and Lemma 3.3, given any D 1 > 0, D 2 > 0, a 1 > 0, a 2 > 0, λ 1 > 0 and λ 2 > 0 we can find c 1 > 0, c 2 > 0 and c 3 > 0 with the property that whenever χ 1 > 0, χ 2 > 0 and (1.5) holds, for F ε and D ε taken from (3.2) and (3.3) we have\n\nand Ω u ε ln(u ε + e) + χ 1\n\nfor all t > 0 and any ε ∈ (0, 1). Moreover, combining the inequalities (2.5) and (2.6) provided by Lemma 2.3 we see that if (1.5) is valid, then there exists\n\nfor all t > T 1 and each ε ∈ (0, 1), (5.12) where m ∞ > 0 is as defined in (2.6). Keeping this value of T 1 fixed henceforth, we now assume that D 1 , D 2 , a 1 , a 2 , λ 1 , λ 2 , χ 1 and χ 2 are given positive constants, and that (1.5) holds. Then an application of Lemma 4.1 yields c 5 = c 5 (χ 1 , χ 2 , u 0 , v 0 ) > 0 such that the correspondingly defined function F ε in (3.2) satisfies F ε (T 1 ) ≤ c 5 for all ε ∈ (0, 1), (5.13) and we thereupon let T 2 = T 2 (χ 1 , χ 2 , u 0 , v 0 ) > T 1 be large enough such that\n\nNext, fixing any T > T 2 + 1 we infer from Lemma 5.3 that Ω u ε ≥ c 6 and Ω v ε ≥ c 6 for all t ∈ (0, T ) and ε ∈ (0, 1) (5. 15) with some suitably small c 6 = c 6 (T, χ 1 , χ 2 , u 0 , v 0 ) > 0, whence it becomes possible to pick ε 0 ≡ ε 0 (T, χ 1 , χ 2 , u 0 , v 0 ) ∈ (0, 1) small enough such that\n\nThen on inserting (5.12) and (5.15) into (5.10) we obtain that\n\nfor all t ∈ (T 1 , T ) and ε ∈ (0, ε 0 ), (5.16) where we underline that besides c 1 , also c 7 := c 2 · (2 + 2c 7 4 ) is independent of both χ 1 and χ 2 as well as u 0 and v 0 . After integration using (5.13) and (5.14), from (5.16) we firstly infer that\n\nfor all t ∈ T 2 , T ) and ε ∈ (0, ε 0 ), (5.17) and that thus in view of (5.11) and (5.12), in particular,\n\nfor all t ∈ (T 2 , T ) and ε ∈ (0, ε 0 ). (5.18) Thanks to (5.17), (5.16) secondly entails that for all t ∈ (T 2 , T ) and each ε ∈ (0, ε 0 ),\n\nfor all t > T 1 and any ε ∈ (0, 1) according to (5.11) and (5.12). Due to the definition (3.3) of D ε , the latter implies (5.9), whereas (5.8) results from (5.18).\n\n6 Eventual bounds II. The conditional quasi-entropy Ω u 2 εx + γ Ω v 2 εx Now approaching the core of our asymptotic analysis, we next intend to improve the information on eventual regularity provided by Lemma 5.4. To this end, in the key Lemma 6.2 we shall study the time evolution of Ω u 2 εx + γ Ω v 2 εx , and more precisely we shall see there that under suitable smallness assumptions on χ 1 and χ 2 , for carefully chosen values of the parameter γ > 0 depending on the ratio χ 1 χ 2 in a subtle manner, this functional enjoys an entropy-like property as long as its values remain small. Using Lemma 5.4 to achieve the latter at least at some large initial time, we will thereby be able to indeed conclude eventual boundedness of both solution components in W 1,2 (Ω).\n\nIn estimating the respective cross-diffusion terms appearing in the corresponding testing procedure adequately, we will make use of the following elementary inequalities. we immediately see that since 1 ≤ 5 − n,\n\nwhence (6.2) becomes evident. Furthermore, since |3 − n| ≤ 5 − n, from (6.4) it follows that\n\nfor all s > 0, (6.5) where clearly I ε (s) := εs 3−n (s 4−n + ε) 2 ≤ εs 3−n s 8−2n = εs n−5 for all s > 0, and where on the other hand by Young's inequality,\n\nfor all s > 0.\n\nAn interpolation therefore shows that since n ≤ 7 2 ,\n\nfor all s > 0, and that thus (6.3) is a consequence of (6.5).\n\nNow the presumably most crucial step toward our derivation both of Theorem 1.2 and of Theorem 1.3 will be accomplished in the course of the following quite delicate argument. Here a considerable technical intricacy originates from the ambition to unambiguously identify smallness assumptions on χ 1 and χ 2 , independently of u 0 and v 0 , and on ε, the latter possibly data-dependent, that ensure the following global absorption property considerably going beyond that from Lemma 2.3.\n\nThen there exist χ ⋆ > 0 and C > 0 with the property that whenever χ 1 ∈ (0, χ ⋆ ) and χ 2 ∈ (0, χ ⋆ ) and (1.5) holds, one can find T ⋆ = T ⋆ (χ 1 , χ 2 , u 0 , v 0 ) > 0 and ε ⋆ = ε ⋆ (χ 1 , χ 2 , u 0 , v 0 ) ∈ (0, 1) such that Ω u 2 εx (·, t) + Ω v 2 εx (·, t) ≤ C for all t > T ⋆ and each ε ∈ (0, ε ⋆ ) (6.6) and u ε (·, t) L ∞ (Ω) + v ε (·, t) L ∞ (Ω) ≤ C for all t > T ⋆ and ε ∈ (0, ε ⋆ ) (6.7)\n\nas well as\n\nt Ω v 2 εxx ≤ C for all t > T ⋆ and any ε ∈ (0, ε ⋆ ). (6.8)\n\nProof.\n\nIn order to prepare our selection of χ ⋆ , taking m ∞ > 0 from Lemma 2.3 let us set m := m ∞ + 1 and repeatedly make use of the Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality to find positive constants c 1 , c 2 , c 3 , c 4 and c 5 such that for any ϕ ∈ W 2,2 (Ω) fulfilling ϕ L 1 (Ω) ≤ m we have\n\nL 2 (Ω) + 1 (6.9) and ϕ 2 L 2 (Ω) ≤ c 2 · ϕ xx L 2 (Ω) + 1 (6.12) and ϕ x 10 9 L 4 (Ω) ≤ c 5 · ϕ xx 7 9 L 2 (Ω) + 1 . (6.13)\n\nBy the same token, we can fix c 6 > 0 and c 7 > 0 such that\n\nfor all ϕ ∈ W 1,2 0 (Ω) (6.14)\n\nand\n\nWe next employ Young's inequality to choose positive numbers c 8 , c 9 , c 10 and c 11 with the properties that\n\nfor all ξ ≥ 0 and η ≥ 0 (6.16) and 2 noting that through the above construction, χ ⋆ indeed only depends on D 1 , D 2 , a 1 , a 2 , λ 1 and λ 2 .\n\nWe now let χ 1 > 0 and χ 2 > 0 be such that\n\nand assuming (1.5) we introduce\n\nwhere γ := c 23 ρ 15 13 with ρ := χ 1 χ 2 ∈ (0, 1]. (6.29) In order to derive an appropriate upper bound for y ε , we first invoke Lemma 2.3 to see that thanks to our definition of m we can pick\n\nfor all t > T 1 and any ε ∈ (0, 1), (6.30) and thereafter employ Lemma 5.4 in choosing T ⋆ = T ⋆ (χ 1 , χ 2 , u 0 , v 0 ) > T 1 +1 and ε 1 = ε 1 (χ 1 , χ 2 , u 0 , v 0 ) ∈ (0, 1) such that\n\naccording to (6.29). Then writing θ := min i∈{1,2} 1 2(4−n i ) we fix ε ⋆ = ε ⋆ (χ 1 , χ 2 , u 0 , v 0 ) ∈ (0, ε 1 ) suitably small fulfilling ε θ ⋆ ≤ min and we claim that these selections ensure that\n\nfor all t > T ⋆ and any ε ∈ (0, ε ⋆ ). (6.34) To verify this, for ε ∈ (0, 1) we consider the set\n\nand first combine the inequalities provided by Lemma 2.5 to see upon dropping two nonnegative summands that for all ε ∈ (0, 1),\n\nfor all t > 0, (6.36) where h i,ε (s) := s 5−n i s 4−n i +ε for s ≥ 0, ε ∈ (0, 1) and i ∈ {1, 2}. Here since γ ≤ 1 by (6.29) and (6.25), in view of (6.30) we may apply (6.9), (6.10), (6.16), (6.17) and Young's inequality to estimate\n\nfor all t > T 1 and ε ∈ (0, 1). (6.37)\n\nNext, due to (6.30), (6.12), (6.18) and (6.21) we have\n\nfor all t > T 1 and ε ∈ (0, 1), (6.38) while similarly (6.30), (6.12), (6.19) and (6.21) ensure that\n\nfor all t > T 1 and ε ∈ (0, 1), (6.39) again because γ ≤ 1.\n\nWe next intend to estimate the cross-diffusive contributions to (6.36), and to this end we use integration by parts in firstly rewriting\n\nfor t > 0, where by Lemma 6.1, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, (6.11) and (6.30),\n\nfor all t > T 1 and ε ∈ (0, 1). Moreover, thanks to Lemma 6.1 and the Hölder inequality,\n\nfor all t > 0 and ε ∈ (0, 1), (6.42) and here combining (6.14) with (6.13), (6.30) and Young's inequality shows that u εx 2 L 4 (Ω) = u εx 8 9 L 4 (Ω) · u εx L 2 (Ω) · u εxx L 2 (Ω) + 1 for all t > T 1 and ε ∈ (0, 1). (6.43) According to (6.41), (6.42) and our definition (6.22) of c 15 , we therefore readily obtain using Young's inequality that since Ω u 2 εx (·, t) ≤ y ε (t) for all t > 0 by (6.28),\n\nfor all t > T 1 and ε ∈ (0, 1). (6.44)\n\nHere we note that since c 22 ≥ 1 and γ ≤ 1 and thus 1 ≤ c 1 3\n\n22 γ − 1 10 by (6.25), in view of (6.29) and (6.26) inside the set S ε in (6.35) we may estimate\n\nfor all t ∈ S ε and each ε ∈ (0, 1), whence (6.44) implies that actually\n\nfor all t ∈ S ε and any ε ∈ (0, 1). (6.45) In the rightmost summand in (6.40), once more relying on Lemma 6.1 enables us to combine Young's inequality with Lemma 2.4 to see that due to (6.22) and our definition of θ, and again thanks to (6.14), for all t > 0 and ε ∈ (0, 1) we have\n\nbecause Ω v 2 εx (·, t) ≤ γ −1 y ε (t) for t > 0 by (6.28). Again restricted to times belonging to S ε , due to (6.35) and (6.32) this implies that\n\nfor all t ∈ S ε and ε ∈ (0, ε ⋆ ). (6.47)\n\nNow by arguments quite similar to those used in (6.40)-(6.47), on splitting\n\nwe may first essentially copy the reasoning from (6.41), (6.42), (6.43), (6.44) and (6.45): Indeed, again using that Ω v 2 εx (·, t) ≤ γ −1 y ε (t) for t > 0 we thereby obtain that\n\nfor all t ∈ S ε and ε ∈ (0, 1), (6.49) because according to (6.35) and the inequalities γ ≤ 1 and c  ≤ 1 for all t ∈ S ε and ε ∈ (0, 1) due to (6.26) and our restriction that 1 ≥ c 3 5 23 . Likewise, proceeding as in (6.46) and (6.47) we find that since Ω u 2 εx (·, t) ≤ y ε (t) < c 22 γ − 3 10 for all t ∈ S ε ,\n\nfor all t ∈ S ε and ε ∈ (0, ε ⋆ ) (6.50) because of (6.33).\n\nWhen inserted into (6.36), in view of (6.40) and (6.48) the estimates (6.37), (6.38), (6.39), (6.45), (6.47), (6.49) and (6.50) in summary show that as γ ≤ 1,\n\nfor all t ∈ S ε and ε ∈ (0, ε ⋆ ) (6.51)\n\naccording to the definition of c 17 in (6.23). In order to turn the two remaining integrals herein into an appropriate superlinear absorptive term, we once more make use of (6.12), (6.30) and Young's inequality to see that again since γ ≤ 1, for all t > T 1 and all ε ∈ (0, 1), so that for all t > T 1 and any ε ∈ (0, 1),\n\nIn light of (6.24), (6.51) therefore entails the autonomous ODI\n\nfor all t ∈ S ε and each ε ∈ (0, ε ⋆ ). (6.52)\n\nTo deduce (6.34) from this, we now recall (6.31) to infer that for each ε ∈ (0, 1) we can fix t ε ∈ (T ⋆ − 1, T ⋆ ) such that\n\nThrough (6.15) and again (6.30), this firstly entails that\n\nand, similarly,\n\nfor all ε ∈ (0, 1).\n\nTherefore, (6.53) secondly implies that\n\nfor all ε ∈ (0, 1) (6.54) by (6.25), for we are yet assuming that ρ ≤ 1.\n\nBut now the precise link between γ and ρ in (6.29) ensures that \n\nfor all ε ∈ (0, 1). (6.55) This especially guarantees that t ε belongs to S ε and that hence\n\nis a well-defined element of (t ε , ∞] for all ε ∈ (0, 1). According to (6.52), however, for each ε ∈ (0, ε ⋆ ) we actually must have T ε = ∞: Otherwise, namely, the definition of S ε would entail that (t ε , T ε ) ⊂ S ε but y ε (T ε ) = c 22 γ − 3 10 , (6.56) while since y(t) := 1 2 c 22 γ − 3 10 , t ≥ t ε , satisfies\n\nas a further consequence of (6.25), a comparison argument based on (6.55) would show that y ε (t) ≤ y(t) for all t ∈ [t ε , T ε ] and thereby contradict (6.56). This confirms that indeed [t ε , ∞) ⊂ S ε for all ε ∈ (0, ε ⋆ ) and that thus (6.34) results from the fact that t ε < T ⋆ for any such ε. In view of (6.30) and e.g. (6.11), we therefore conclude that both (6.6) and (6.7) are valid whenever 0 < χ 1 ≤ χ 2 < χ ⋆ , whereupon going back to (6.51) we infer by integration that also (6.8) holds for all such χ 1 and χ 2 .\n\nand thereby especially entails (6.57) by compactness of the embedding W 1,2 (Ω) ֒→ L ∞ (Ω). Since thus (u(·, t)) t∈(T⋆ ,∞)\\N and (v(·, t)) t∈(T⋆ ,∞)\\N are bounded in W 1,2 (Ω) due to (6.62) and (6.60), and since from Lemma 4.5 we already know that both u and v belong to C 0 w ([0, ∞); L 1 (Ω)), it can therefore easily be verified that actually u and v are continuous throughout (T ⋆ , ∞) as W 1,2 (Ω)-valued functions with respect to the weak topology therein. Again through compactness of the embedding W 1,2 (Ω) ֒→ L ∞ (Ω), this entails that indeed u and v are contained in C 0 ((T ⋆ , ∞); C 0 (Ω)) and satisfy (6.59). Apart from that, for all T > T ⋆ (6.61) ensures boundedness of the families (u ε ) ε∈(0,ε⋆) and (v ε ) ε∈(0,ε⋆) in L 2 ((T ⋆ , T ); W 2,2 (Ω)), so that recalling the time regularity properties from Lemma 4.4 we may once more invoke the Aubin-Lions lemma to conclude that u ε → u and v ε → v in L 2 ((T ⋆ , t); W 1,2 (Ω)), and that thus in particular (6.58) holds.\n\nToward verifying consistency with a genuine entropy structure\n\nNow having at hand the eventual regularity properties gained above, for establishing our main results on stabilization in the flavor of Theorem 1.2 and Theorem 1.3 it will be sufficient to make sure that the genuine gradient-like structures related to the functionals in (1.12) and (1.14) find some appropriate rigorous counterpart in the approximate problems (1.6)-(1.7). This short section provides the fundament therefor by recording results of associated testing procedures, which will in particular foreshadow our final selections of the key parameters n 1 and n 2 . i) If n 1 = 2, then for all ε ∈ (0, 1),\n\nii) If n 2 = 2, then for all ε ∈ (0, 1),\n\nu ε for all t > 0. (7.2) iii) In the case n 2 = 1, for all ε ∈ (0, 1) we have d dt\n\nProof. i) Writing ℓ(s) := − ln s + ε 6 · 1 s 2 for s > 0 and fixed ε ∈ (0, 1), we have ℓ ′ (s) = − 1 s − ε 3s 3 = − 3s 2 +ε 3s 3 and ℓ ′′ (s) = 1 s 2 + ε s 4 = s 2 +ε s 4 for all s > 0, so that using the first equation in (1.6) we obtain\n\nfor all t > 0.\n\nAs clearly ε Ω u εx u εxxx = −ε Ω u 2 εxx for all t > 0, this is equivalent to (7.1). ii) This part analogously follows from the second equation in (1.6).\n\niii) We now rather let ℓ(s) := 1 2 s 2 + ε 2s for s > 0 and ε ∈ (0, 1), and observing that then ℓ ′ (s) = s − ε 2s 2 = 2s 3 −ε 2s 2 and ℓ ′′ (s) = 1 + ε s 3 = s 3 +ε s 3 for all s > 0, we use (1.6)-(1.7) to compute\n\nfor all t > 0, and since 3s(2s 3 − ε) 2 · (3s 2 + ε) = s 2 − ε · 2s 2 + 3s 6s 2 + 2ε for all s > 0, this yields (7.3).\n\n8 The case λ 2 > a 2 λ 1 . Proof of Theorem 1.2\n\nIn our convergence argument concentrating on the situation of Theorem 1.2 first, in view of (1.12) our design of an approximate variant of the functional therein will be based on parts i) and ii) of Lemma 7.1, thus suggesting to fix n 1 = n 2 = 2 henceforth in this case. For our construction here and also for later reference, let us separately state some elementary properties of the nonlinear map arising in both integrals in (1.12).\n\nThen φ ξ⋆ is positive on (0, ∞) \\ {ξ ⋆ } with φ ξ⋆ (ξ ⋆ ) = 0, and furthermore\n\nProof. Since φ ′ ξ⋆ (ξ) = 1 − ξ⋆ ξ and φ ′′ ξ⋆ (ξ) = ξ⋆ ξ 2 for all ξ > 0, it is clear that the zero ξ ⋆ of φ ξ⋆ is a strict and global minimum point of φ ξ⋆ , and that moreover\n\nfor all ξ ≥ ξ⋆ 2 . Then combining lemma 7.1 with (1.12) suggests to generalize the entropy structure in question as follows.\n\nLemma 8.2 Let n 1 = n 2 = 2, and suppose that D i > 0, a i > 0, λ i > 0 and χ i > 0 for i ∈ {1, 2}, with λ 2 > a 2 λ 1 .\n\nand, similarly,\n\nfor all t > 0. Therefore, after neglecting some signed summands and rearranging we infer from (8.7) that\n\nΩ v ε for all t > 0. (8.8) We now make use of our definition (8.4) of A, which along with (1.11) namely ensures the precise identities λ 1 + u ⋆ + Aa 2 v ⋆ = λ 1 + u ⋆ + a 1 v ⋆ = 2u ⋆ and Aλ 2 − a 1 u ⋆ + Av ⋆ = 2Av ⋆ as well as\n\nand clearly also a 1 − Aa 2 = 0. Accordingly, in (8.8) we may simplify\n\nfor all t > 0 and ε ∈ (0, 1), and thus end up with (8.6).\n\nIn view of the eventual bounds derived in Section 6, for small values of χ 1 and χ 2 but arbitrarily large u 0 and v 0 this readily entails an inequality for E 1,ε which in the formal limit ε ց 0 indeed predicts eventual decrease thereof. In view of the definition (8.10) of D 1,ε , this implies (8.12).\n\nFor drawing conclusions from the resulting autonomous ODI for E 1,ε , let us a quantitative consequence of a simple comparison argument.\n\nLemma 8.5 Let t 0 ∈ R, T > t 0 , a > 0, b > 0 and β > 1, and suppose that y ∈ C 0 ([t 0 , T )) ∩ C 1 ((t 0 , T )) is nonnegative and such that y ′ (t) + ay β (t) ≤ b for all t ∈ (t 0 , T ). Proof. Without loss of generality we assume that t 0 = 0, and observe that y(t) := ((β−1)at)\n\nβ , t > 0, satisfies\n\nfor all t > 0 due to the fact that (ξ + η) β ≥ ξ β + η β for all ξ ≥ 0 and η ≥ 0. Since y(t) ր +∞ as t ց 0, by continuity of y at t = 0 this readily implies the claimed inequality by means of a comparison argument.\n\nWe can thus reap the fruit of Lemma 8.3 and Lemma 8.4 and thereby obtain, through the dissipation mechanism expressed in (8.9), the following preliminary decay information for our solution to the original problem.\n\nLemma 8.6 Let n 1 = n 2 = 2, let D i > 0, a i > 0, λ i > 0 and χ i > 0 for i ∈ {1, 2} be such that (8.3) holds, and let χ 1 ∈ (0, χ ⋆⋆ ) and χ 2 ∈ (0, χ ⋆⋆ ) with χ ⋆⋆ > 0 as in Lemma 8.3. Then assuming (1.5), one can find T 0 = T 0 (χ 1 , χ 2 , u 0 , v 0 ) > 0 such that for the limit functions u and v obtained in Lemma 4.5 we have\n\nwith u ⋆ > 0 and v ⋆ > 0 taken from (1.11).\n\nWe next make use of favorable smallness properties, as implied by (8.19) for certain arbitrarily large times which we use as new starting instants, to see on going back to (8.9), but this time simply neglecting the positive summand D 1,ε therein, that u and v in fact approach their expected limits in a sense much stronger than indicated in Lemma 8.6, albeit not yet identified as spatially uniform but rather in a topology associated with the entropy functional in (1.12).\n\nLemma 8.7 Let n 1 = n 2 = 2, let D i > 0, a i > 0, λ i > 0 and χ i > 0, i ∈ {1, 2}, satisfy (8.3), and let χ 1 ∈ (0, χ ⋆⋆ ) and χ 2 ∈ (0, χ ⋆⋆ ) with χ ⋆⋆ > 0 taken from Lemma 8.3. Then assuming (1.5) and letting u, v and N be as given by Lemma 4.5, with φ u⋆ and φ v⋆ taken from (8.1) and (1.11) we have Ω φ u⋆ (u(·, t)) → 0 and Ω φ v⋆ (v(·, t)) → 0 as (0, ∞) \\ N ∋ t → ∞. (8.23) Now thanks to the eventual precompactness features implied by Corollary 6.3, due to the positivity of φ ξ⋆ outside the point ξ ⋆ > 0 the latter readily implies the desired convergence statement.\n\nLemma 8.8 Let n 1 = n 2 = 2, let D i > 0, a i > 0, λ i > 0 and χ i > 0 for i ∈ {1, 2} be such that (8.3) is fulfilled, and let χ 1 ∈ (0, χ ⋆⋆ ) and χ 2 ∈ (0, χ ⋆⋆ ) with χ ⋆⋆ > 0 as in Lemma 8.3. Then whenever (1.5) holds, as t → ∞, the limit functions u and v obtained in Lemma 4.5 satisfy u(·, t) → u ⋆ in L ∞ (Ω) and v(·, t) → v ⋆ in L ∞ (Ω), (8.36) where u ⋆ > 0 and v ⋆ > 0 are as in (1.11).\n\nProof. From Corollary 6.3 we know that there exists T 0 > 0 such that (u(·, t)) t>T 0 is bounded in W 1,2 (Ω) and hence relatively compact in C 0 (Ω), whence if (8.36) was false, the we could find (t k ) k∈N ⊂ (T 0 , ∞) and u ∞ ∈ C 0 (Ω) such that u ∞ ≡ u ⋆ and that t k → ∞ as well as u(·, t k ) → u ∞ in L ∞ (Ω) as k → ∞. As in view of Corollary 6.3 we may assume u to be continuous in Ω × (T 0 , ∞), by density of [t k , t k +1]\\N in [t k , t k +1] we can pick t k ∈ [t k , t k +1] such that u(·, t k )−u(·, t k ) L ∞ (Ω) ≤ 1 k , meaning that also u(·, t k ) → u ∞ in L ∞ (Ω) as k → ∞. As the function φ u⋆ from (8.1) is positive in (0, ∞) \\ {u ⋆ } by Lemma 8.1, however, the hypothesis u ∞ ≡ u ⋆ implies that Ω φ u⋆ (u(·, t k )) → 0 as k → ∞, in contradiction to Lemma 8.7. Along with a similar argument for v, this establishes the claim.\n\nThe proof of our main result on kinetics-driven stabilization has thereby already been accomplished:\n\nProof of Theorem 1.2. We only need to combine Corollary 6.3 with Lemma 8.8.\n\n9\n\nThe case λ 2 ≤ a 2 λ 1 . Proof of Theorem 1.3\n\nIn the context addressed in Theorem 1.3, in view of Lemma 7.1 the form of the functional in (1.14) suggests to choose still n 1 = 2 but now rather n 2 = 1. Our analysis will then quite closely follow the lines presented in the previous section, so that here it will be sufficient to concentrate on the main modifications only.\n\nThe fundament for convergence is constituted by a natural counterpart of Lemma 8.2.\n\nProof. Again relying on Corollary 6.3 and Lemma 8.1, one can readily obtain this as a consequence of Lemma 9.5 by means of an argument in the flavor of that presented in the proof of Lemma 8.8.\n\nWe have thereby established our main result on asymptotic dominance of the predator population when λ 2 ≤ a 2 λ 1 .\n\nProof of Theorem 1.3. All statements have been verified in Corollary 6.3 and Lemma 9.6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "annotations": {"sentence": null, "paragraph":

Those numbers reflect well on the high quality of healthcare in Taiwan. The life expectancy in Taiwan has better infant mortality rate [1]. \n\nResult: What is remarkable is that the Taiwan's national health insurance system is cheap compared to that of the United States. Taiwan spends 6 percent of its GDP on healthcare, compared with the US' 15.3 percent. 1 Experts say that the key to Taiwan's more efficient nursing care and health care systems seems to be the combination of a single-payer system with world-beating healthcare technology. \n\nTaiwan launched its single-payer system in 1995. Nine years later, a \"smart card\" was introduced. Each of Taiwan's 23 million people has a card with basic identification and medical data on it. When a Taiwanese patient goes to a clinic or hospital, a swipe of the card immediately gives the doctor instant access to all that data. And information on the visit is uploaded to a central database that gives the government a near \"real time\" lucid picture of healthcare patterns [2]. The effective use of information technology as well keeps administrative costs so low that it is now 1.5 percent of total medical expenditures and is probably the lowest cost in the world. Undeniablly, there is some buzz about the digital future of U.S. nursing care and healthcare and then are centered on the electronic health records. \n\nThe biggest advancement might be the small card we can carry with us. The plastic credit card carries all the essentials data of nursing and health cares: medical records, insurance information, prescriptions, and also reimbursements. It not only can be used to check in, but also if it's used quite effectively, can easily identify both the patients, and providers with a complete background data on the patients whenever they visiting. The United States is a global superpower and the most innovative country in this world. Yet it has not entered the smart-card market largely because of its fragmented health-care system. We do have thousands of private hospitals and insurers and no single government agency to act as the issuer. The overview of the smart card and network technology; privacy and security requirements are to be noted. As to benefits of using IC cards are quite obvious [3]. Any disadvantages of using them may be due to privacy concerns. As per Denish D'Souza in his book 4, p.19, Russia is one of the most atheist countries in the world, and abortions there outnumber live births by a ratio of two to one. Russia's birth rate has fallen so low that the entire nation is now losing 700,000 people a year. Japan, perhaps the most secular country in Asia, is also on a kind of population decline: its 130 million people are expected to drop to around 100 million in the next few decades. \n\nCanada, Australia, and New Zealand find themselves in a similar predicament. Then there is Europe. The most secular continent on this globe is decadent in the quite literal that population is rapidly shrinking. Well, Nietzsches \"last man\" is finally here, and his name is Sven! Nevertheless, most this author's Christiam pals feel that 'do not worry!' This world is already overpopulated This author does not deem Christianity promote more birth rate. Apostle Paul used to advise if for widows, then, as it is said in the BIBLE New Testament, in the 1 Chorinthine 7:1 preferring not to get re-married. That is why Catholic has priests and nuns. The high abortion rate in Russia, if that is true, may reflect low availability of contraceptives. The Caucasian people already colonized Siberia. Americas and Australia. China, if not for the one child-policy, would still be a poor country [4]. Meanwhile the non-Christian countries in South Asia, Mideast and Africa have population explosion and sending most \"refugees\" everywhere else!. \n\nConclusion\n\nHow can IC card helps patients, hospitals, and providers? What is 'Don't worry'? This world is already overpopulated. I don' think Christianity promote babies. Paul advised not to get married. That is why Catholic has priests and nuns. The high abortion rate in Russia, if that is true, may reflect low availability of ant effective contraceptives. The Caucasians already colonized Siberia. Americas and Australia. China, if not for the one child policy, would still be a poor country. Meanwhile the non-Christian countries in South Asia, Mideast and Africa have population explosion and sending \"refugees\" everywhere. Conversely, will any change in the government's health policy push the hospitals and providers toward the direction of smart card technology? \n", "annotations": {"sentence": "[{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":\"180\",\"start\":\"44\"},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":\"252\",\"start\":\"181\"},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":\"320\",\"start\":\"253\"},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":\"451\",\"start\":\"323\"},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":\"723\",\"start\":\"452\"},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":\"774\",\"start\":\"726\"},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":\"823\",\"start\":\"775\"},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":\"919\",\"start\":\"824\"},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":\"1056\",\"start\":\"920\"},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":\"1206\",\"start\":\"1057\"},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":\"1395\",\"start\":\"1207\"},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":\"1544\",\"start\":\"1396\"},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":\"1616\",\"start\":\"1547\"},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":\"1781\",\"start\":\"1617\"},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":\"1984\",\"start\":\"1782\"},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":\"2072\",\"start\":\"1985\"},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":\"2171\",\"start\":\"2073\"},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":\"2280\",\"start\":\"2172\"},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":\"2386\",\"start\":\"2281\"},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":\"2442\",\"start\":\"2387\"},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":\"2506\",\"start\":\"2443\"},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":\"2675\",\"start\":\"2507\"},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":\"2773\",\"start\":\"2676\"},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":\"2954\",\"start\":\"2774\"},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":\"3033\",\"start\":\"2957\"},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":\"3055\",\"start\":\"3034\"},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":\"3167\",\"start\":\"3056\"},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":\"3234\",\"start\":\"3168\"},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":\"3308\",\"start\":\"3235\"},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":\"3408\",\"start\":\"3309\"},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":\"3558\",\"start\":\"3409\"},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":\"3601\",\"start\":\"3559\"},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":\"3700\",\"start\":\"3602\"},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":\"3748\",\"start\":\"3701\"},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":\"3772\",\"start\":\"3749\"},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":\"3847\",\"start\":\"3773\"},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":\"3991\",\"start\":\"3848\"},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":\"4063\",\"start\":\"4006\"},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":\"4086\",\"start\":\"4064\"},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":\"4123\",\"start\":\"4087\"},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":\"4165\",\"start\":\"4124\"},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":\"4198\",\"start\":\"4166\"},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":\"4241\",\"start\":\"4199\"},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":\"4354\",\"start\":\"4242\"},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":\"4396\",\"start\":\"4355\"},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":\"4420\",\"start\":\"4397\"},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":\"4491\",\"start\":\"4421\"},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":\"4624\",\"start\":\"4492\"},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":\"4766\",\"start\":\"4625\"}]", "paragraph": "[{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":321,\"start\":44},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":724,\"start\":323},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":1545,\"start\":726},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":2955,\"start\":1547},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":3992,\"start\":2957},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":4767,\"start\":4006}]", "section_header": "[{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":12,\"start\":1},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":42,\"start\":14},{\"attributes\":null,\"end\":4004,\"start\":3994}]", "bib_ref": "[{\"attributes\":{\"ref_id\":\"b0\"},\"end\":319,\"start\":316},{\"attributes\":{\"ref_id\":\"b1\"},\"end\":1205,\"start\":1202},{\"attributes\":{\"ref_id\":\"b2\"},\"end\":2441,\"start\":2438},{\"attributes\":{\"ref_id\":\"b3\"},\"end\":3846,\"start\":3843}]"}}}
