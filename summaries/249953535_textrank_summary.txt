We thus use only the standard episodes from the base NovelCraft dataset for training and validation to maximize diversity in this task's test set, which contains standard episodes and all available gameplay novelty episodes. In our evaluation we assume prior knowledge of the number of new classes in the unlabeled set, but future evaluations may utilize the method in Vaze et al. To handle this, we only score images in the filtered subset of the test set, where we are more confident in the label. In the event of a novel change in the environment, such as some trees not producing rubber, the agent must be able to change multiple steps in the solution, such as breaking those trees for wood and not using the tree tap on them, to successfully complete the modified task. In addition to the Fence and Tree novelties, we add new Supplier and Thief gameplay novelties, which are exclusive to this task due to only being labeled at the episode level instead of at the frame level.
